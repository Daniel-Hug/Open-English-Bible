; WH contains variants marked in Luke that the 20CNT kept in square brackets. We will remove them for the moment, potentially adding them back in if and when we choose to mark major variants.  Removing these is in line with the choices of REB among others.

In Luke:
    24:3    [of the Lord Jesus] -> ~
    24:36   them, [and said \wj “Peace be with you.”\wj*  ] -> them.
    24:40   [After saying this he showed them his hands and his feet.] -> ~
    24:51   them [and was carried up into Heaven.] -> them.
    24:52   They [bowed to the ground before him and] returned -> They returned
