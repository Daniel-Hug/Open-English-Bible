; Clear up a bit.

In Galatians
4:24 One covenant, given from Mount Sinai, produces a race of slaves and is represented by Hagar -> One covenant comes from Mount Sinai: Hagar, whose children are slaves.
4:25 (The word Hagar meaning in Arabia Mount Sinai) and it ranks with the Jerusalem of today, for she and her children are in slavery -> Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and for Jerusalem today, because she and her children are in slavery.
