;  From GitHub: In translating the greek word thÃ©sauros as "treasures" it misses some of the apparent meaning in the term. http://strongsnumbers.com/greek/2344.htm
; "a receptacle for valuables" seems implied in the definition of the word.  Other translations use the term "treasure chests," "treasure-chest" or "treasure bags"

In Matthew:
    ; they unpacked their treasures, and offered to the child presents of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. \
    2:11    unpacked their treasures  ->  opened their treasure chests
