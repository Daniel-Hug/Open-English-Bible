In John:
    2:24    But Jesus did not trust himself to them, since he could read every heart, -> But Jesus did not put himself in their power because he knew what was in their hearts. 
    2:25    and because he did not need that others should tell him what men were; for he could of himself read what was in men -> He did not need anyone to tell him about people because he could read what was in them.
