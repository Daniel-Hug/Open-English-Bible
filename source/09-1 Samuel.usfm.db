\h 1 Samuel
\mt The First Book of Samuel 

\c 1

\v 1 Now there was a certain man of Ramah, a Zuphite of the hill-country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.

\v 2 And he had two wives: the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah; and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none.

\v 3 And this man used to go up from his city year by year to worship and to sacrifice to Jehovah of hosts in Shiloh. And Eli and his two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were there priests unto Jehovah.

\v 4 And it came to pass on one occasion that Elkanah sacrificed. Now he used to give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters, 

\v 5 but to Hannah he used to give one portion, although he loved Hannah; but Jehovah had shut up her womb. 

\v 6 And her rival used to vex her bitterly in order to make her angry, because Jehovah had shut up her womb.

\v 7 And thus he did year by year, as often as she went up to the house of Jehovah, she used to vex her; therefore she wept and would not eat. 

\v 8 But Elkanah her husband said to her, Hannah, why do you weep and not eat, and why is your heart sad? Am not I better to you than ten sons?

\v 9 So Hannah rose up, after they had eaten in Shiloh and stood before Jehovah. Now Eli the priest was sitting at his seat at the door-posts of the temple of Jehovah.

\v 10 And she was greatly distressed and prayed fervently to Jehovah and wept bitterly. 

\v 11 And she vowed a vow, saying,

\q O Jehovah of hosts!
\q If thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy maid-servant, 
\q And remember me and not forget thy maid-servant,
\q But wilt give to thy maid-servant a man child,
\q Then I will give him to Jehovah all the days of his life.
\q And a razor shall not come upon his head.

\v 12 And while she continued praying before Jehovah, Eli observed her mouth. 

\v 13 Now Hannah was speaking to herself; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard; therefore Eli took her for a drunken woman.

\v 14 So Eli said to her, How long will you act like a drunken woman? Put away the effects of your wine and go from the presence of Jehovah.

\v 15  But Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, an unfortunate woman am I; I have drunk neither wine nor intoxicating drink, but I have been pouring out my soul before Jehovah. 

\v 16 Do not take your maid-servant to be a vile woman, for because of the greatness of my grief and vexation have I continued speaking until now.

\v 17 Then Eli answered and said. Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of him.

\v 18 And she said, Let your maid-servant find favor in your sight. So the woman went her way and ate, and her countenance was no more sad.

\v 19 And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before Jehovah, and returned and came to their house at Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and Jehovah remembered her.

\v 20 And Hannah conceived, and it came to pass at the coming around of the new year that she bore a son, and called his name Samuel [Asked of God], saying, For I have asked him of Jehovah.

\v 21 And the man Elkanah and all his household went up to offer to Jehovah the yearly sacrifice and his vow.

\v 22 But Hannah did not go up; for she said to her husband, When the child is weaned then I will bring him and he shall appear in the presence of Jehovah and shall dwell there forever. 

\v 23 Elkanah her husband said to her. Do what seems good to you: wait until you have weaned him; only may Jehovah establish your word. So the woman waited and nursed her son until she weaned him.

\v 24 And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, together with a three-year-old bullock and a bushel of flour and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of Jehovah in Shiloh.

\v 25 And they slew the bullock and Hannah brought the lad to Eli.

\v 26 And she said, Oh, sir, by your life, I am the woman who stood near you here, praying fervently to Jehovah. 

\v 27 This is the lad regarding whom I was fervently praying, and Jehovah has granted me my petition which I asked of him.

\v 28 Now, I on my part have given him to Jehovah; as long as he lives he is given to Jehovah.

\c 2

\v 11 So she left him there before Jehovah and went to Ramah. But the lad was ministering to Jehovah in the presence of Eli the priest.

\v 12 Now the sons of Eli were base scoundrels; they had no regard for Jehovah, 

\v 13 nor for what was justly due the priest from the people. Whenever a man offered a sacrifice, the priest's servant would come, while the flesh was boiling, with a three-pronged fork in his hand,

\v 14 and would strike into the pot or the kettle or the basin or the dish. All that the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. So they did to all the Israelites who came to sacrifice to Jehovah in Shiloh.

\v 15 Moreover before they burned the fat, the priest's servant used to come and say to the man who was making the offering. Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not take from you boiled flesh, but raw.

\v 16 Should the man, however, say to him, First you should burn the fat, then take as much as you desire, he would reply, No, you must give it at once or else I will take it by force.

\v 17 Thus the sin of the young men was very great before Jehovah; for the men despised the offering of Jehovah.

\v 18 And Samuel continued ministering before Jehovah — a lad girded with a linen ephod.

\v 19 And his mother used to make him a little robe and bring it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.

\v 20 And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife and said, Jehovah repay you with offspring from this woman for the gift which she gave to Jehovah. Then they returned to their own home.

\v 21 And Jehovah visited Hannah so that she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew up before Jehovah.

\v 22 But Eli was very old; and whenver hc heard what his sons were doing to all Israel, how they lay with the women who did service at the door of the tent of meeting,

\v 23 he said to them. Why do you do such things as these, which I hear from the mouth of all the people.

\v 24 No, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear the people of Jehovah spreading abroad,

\v 25 If one man sin against another, God will mediate for him; but if a man sin against Jehovah, who shall act as mediator for him? Notwithstanding they did not listen to the voice of their father, because Jehovah desired to slay them. 

\v 26 But the lad Samuel kept on growing larger and better in the estimation both of Jehovah and of men.

\v 27 And there came a man of God to Eli and said to him, Thus saith Jehovah, 'I revealed myself to thy father's house, when they were in Egypt servants to Pharaoh's house, 

\v 28 and I chose him from all the tribes of Israel to be my priest to go up to mine altar to burn sacrifices, to bear an ephod before me, and I gave to thy father's house for food all the offerings of the Israelites made by fire.

\v 29 Why dost thou look with envious eyes upon my sacrifices and offerings, and honorest thy sons above me in fattening yourselves with the first-fruits of all the offerings which the Israelites bring me?' Therefore Jehovah the God of Israel saith, 'I had indeed thought that thy house and the house of thy father would walk before me forever;' but now saith Jehovah, 'Far be it from me; for them that honor me I will honor, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed. 

\v 31 The days are quickly coming when I Will cut off thine arm and the arm of thy father's house.

\v 32 And thou shalt. look in affliction and enviously upon all the prosperity which I will give Israel; and there shall not be an old man in thy house forever. 

\v 33 And the man of thine whom I do not cut off from mine altar shall be spared to consume his eyes and to wear out his soul, and all the increase of thy house shall die by the sword of men. 

\v 34 And this shall be the sign to thee that shall come upon thy two sons, Hophni and Phinehas: on the same day both shall die. 

\v 35 And I will raise up for myself a faithful priest who shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my desire; and I will build him an enduring house; and he shall walk before mine anointed forever. 

\v 36 And it shall come to pass that every one who is left in thy house shall come to do him obeisance for a piece of money or a loaf of bread, and shall say, 'Put me, I beg, in one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.'

\c 3 

\v 1 And the child Samuel continued ministering before Jehovah in the The presence of Eli. And the word of Jehovah was rare in those days; there was no frequent vision. 

\v 2 Now once at that time, when Eli was lying in his Samuel
place—his eyes had begun to grow dim, so that he could not see-

\v 3 and while the lamp of God was still burning, and Samuel was lying in the temple of Jehovah where the ark of God was, 

\v 4 Jehovah called, Samuel! Samuel! And he said, Here am I. 

\v 5 And he ran to Eli, and said, Here am I; for you called me. But he said, I did not call, lie down again. So he went and lay down. 

\v 6 Then Jehovah called yet again, Samuel! Samuel! And Samuel arose and went to Eli and said, Here am I; for you called me. But he answered, I did not call, my son; lie down again. 

\v 7 Now Samuel did not yet know Jehovah neither had the word of Jehovah yet been revealed to him. 

\v 8 So when Jehovah called Samuel again the third time, he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for you called me. Then Eli perceived that Jehovah was calling the child. 

\v 9 Therefore Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down; and if you are called, say, 'Speak, Jehovah; for thy servant is listening.' So Samuel went and lay down in his place.

\v 10 Then Jehovah came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel! Samuel! And Samuel said, Speak; for thy servant is listening. 

\v 11 And Jehovah said to Samuel, See, I am about to do such a thing in Israel, that the  ears of every one who hears it shall ring. 

\v 12 In that day I will perform toward Eli all that I have spoken against his house from beginning to end. For I have told him that I will judge his house forever, for the guilt which he knew, in that his sons were blaspheming God and he did not rebuke them. And therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the guilt of Eli's house shall not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering forever.

\v 15 And Samuel lay until the morning; then he rose early in the morning and opened the doors of the house of Jehovah. And Samuel feared to make the known the vision to Eli. 

\v 16 But Eli called Samuel and said, Samuel, my son. And he said, Here am I. 

\v 17 And he said, What is the thing that Jehovah hath spoken to you? I pray, conceal nothing from me; may God do to you whatever he will, if you conceal from me a word of all that he spoke to you. 

\v 18 So Samuel told him everything; and concealed nothing from him. And he said, It is Jehovah; let him do what seems good to him.

And Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground. And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established as a prophet of Jehovah. 

\v 21 And Jehovah  again appeared in Shiloh, for Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel. Thus prophet the word of Samuel came to all Israel.

\c 4 

\v 1 Now in those days the Philistines assembled to make war against Israel. Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped at Ebenezer; and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.

\v 2 And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel, and Israel was smitten before the Philistines, and the battle was hard fought and they slew in the ranks on the field about four thousand men.

\v 3 But when the people returned to the camp, the elders of Israel said, Why hath Jehovah smitten us to-day before the Philistines ? Let us bring to us the ark of our God out of Shiloh, that it may come among us and save us from the hand of our enemies.

\v 4 So they sent to Shiloh; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of God. And they took from there the ark of Jehovah of hosts who sits enthroned above the cherubim. 

\v 5 And when the ark of God Jehovah came to the the camp, all Israel shouted a great shout. 

\v 6 And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, 

\v 7 The Philistines were afraid, for they said, These are their gods; they have come to them to the camp.

\v 8 Woe to Woe to us ! for it has not us ! Who shall deliver us out of the hand o these mighty gods? These are the gods who smote the Egyptians with every sort of plagues and pesilence.

\v 9 Be strong, and be men, O Philistines, that you may not be slaves to the Hebrews, as they have been slaves to you.

\v 10 So the Philistines fought and there was great slaughter. Israel was defeated and fled each to his tent. And there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.

\v 11 And the ark of God was taken, and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, perished.

\v 12 And a Benjamite ran from the ranks and came to Shiloh the same day with his garments torn and with earth on his head

\v 13 And just as he came, Eli was sitting upon his seat beside the gate watching the road, for his heart was trembling for the ark of God. And when the man came to the city to inform it, all the city cried out.

\v 14 And when Eli heard the noise of the crying he said, What is this tumultuous noise ? And the man came quickly and told Eli. 

\v 15 (Now Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes were set, so that he could not see).

\v 16 And the man said to Eli, I am he who came from the ranks, for I fled today from the ranks. And he said, How went the matter, my son ? 

\v 17 And he that brought the tidings answered and said, Israel fled before the Philistines, and there was also a great slaughter among the people, and your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured. 

\v 18 And it came to pass when he mentioned the ark of God, that Eli fell from his seat backward by the side of the gate; and his neck was broken and he died, for he was old and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.

\v 19 And his daughter-in-law, Phinehas's wife, was with child, about to be delivered. And when she heard the report regarding the capture of the ark of God, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and gave birth to a child; for her birth-pains came upon her. 

\v 20 And about the time of her death the women who stood by her said to her, Fear not for you have given birth to a son. But she neither answered nor heeded. 

\v 21 Therefore they named the child Ichabod [No glory], saying, The glory is taken away from Israel, because of the capture of the ark of God, and because of her father-in-law and her husband.

\c 5 

\v 1 And the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.

\v 2Then the Philistines took the ark of Jehovahn and brought it to the house of Dagon and set it up by the side of Dagon. 

\v 3 And when the Ashdodites arose early the next day and came to the house of Dagon, behold there was Dagon fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of Jehovah. And they raised up Dagon and set him in his place again. 

\v 4 But when they arose early on the following morning, behold there was Dagon fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of Jehovah. And the head of Dagon and both his hands were cut off upon the threshold, and only the body of Dagon was left. 

\v 5 Therefore the priests of Dagon and all who enter the house of Dagon do not tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day, but leap over it.

\v 6 And the hand of Jehovah was heavy upon the Ashdodites, and he destroyed them, and smote them with boils, even Ashdod and its borders.

\v 7 And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, the ark of the God of Israel shall not remain with us; for his hand is severe upon us and Dagon our god. 

\v 8 So they sent and gathered all the tyrants of the Philistines to them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel ? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be brought around to Gath. So they brought the ark of the God of Israel around. 

\v 9 But after they had brought it around, the hand of Jehovah was against the city—there was a very great panic—and he smote the men of the city, both young and old, so that boils broke out upon them. 

\v 10 Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. But when the ark of God came to Ekron, the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought around the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people. "

\v 11 They sent therefore and gathered together all the tyrants of the Philistines and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, that it may go back to its own place and not kill us and our people. For a deadly panic had seized the entire city; the hand of God was very heavy there. 

\v 12 And the men who did not die were smitten with the boils; and the cry of lamentation from the city went up to heaven.

\c 6 

\v 1 And the ark of Jehovah was in the country of the Philistines seven months.

\v 2 Then the Philistines summoned the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do with the ark of Jehovah ? Show us how we shall send it to its place. 

\v 3 And they said, If you are sending the ark of the God of Israel, you must not send it away empty; but you must return to him a trespass-offering. Then you will be healed and it shall be made known to you why his hand is not removed from you. 

\v 4 Then said they, What shall be the trespass-offering which we shall return to him ? And they said, Five golden boils, and five golden mice, corresponding to the number of the tyrants of the Philistines; for one plague was upon you as well as upon your tyrants.

\v 5 Therefore you shall make images of your boils, and images of your mice that mar the land; and you shall give glory to the God of Israel; perhaps he will lighten his hand
from upon you and your gods and your land.

\v 6 Why then will you make your hearts stubborn, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh made their hearts stubborn ? Was it not after he had made sport of them that they let them go so that they departed ?

\v 7 Now therefore take and prepare a new cart, and two milch cows upon which the yoke has not come; and fasten the cows to the cart, but you shall leave their calves behind them at home. 

\v 8 And take the ark of Jehovah and place it on the cart and put the golden objects which you are returning to him as a trespass-offering, in a box at its side. Then send it away that it may depart. 

\v 9 And see, if it goes on the way to its own border to Bethshemesh, then it is he who hath done us this great harm, but if not, then we shall know that it was not his hand that smote us; it was an accident that befell us.

\v 10 And the men did so, and took two mulch cows and fastened them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home. 

\v 11 And they placed the ark of Jehovah on the cart, and the box with the golden mice and the images of their threew boils. 

\v 12 And the cows took a straight course in the direction of Bethshemesh; they went along the highway, lowing as they went, and did not turn aside to the right hand or to the left. And the tyrants of the Philistines went after them to the border of Bethshemesh. 

\v 13 And the inhabitants of Bethshemesh were harvesting their wheat in the valley. And they lifted up their eyes and saw the ark, and came rejoicing to meet it.

\v 14 And when the cart came into the field of Joshua the Bethshemeshite, it stood still there. And a great stone was there. So they split up the wood of the cart and
offered the cows as a burnt-offering to Jehovah. 

\v 18 But the Levites took down the ark of Jehovah and the box that was with it, in which were the golden objects, and placed them on the great stone; and the men of Bethshemesh offered to Jehovah on that day burnt-offerings and ordinary sacrifices. 

\v 16 And when the five tyrants of the Philistines saw it, they returned to Ekron on that day.

\v 17 And these are the golden boils which the Philistines returned as a trespass-offering to Jehovah: for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Ashkelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one. 

\v 18 But the golden mice correspond to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five tyrants, both of fortified cities and of country villages. And a witness is the great stone,e by which they set down the ark of Jehovah. To this day it is in the field of Joshua of Bethshemesh.

\v 19 The sons of Jechoniah, however, did not rejoice with the men of Bethshemesh, when they looked upon the ark of Jehovah. So he smote among them seventy men; and the people mourned because Jehovah had smitten the people with a great slaughter. 

\v 20 And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before Jehovah this holy God ? And to whom shall he go up from us ? 

\v 21 Then they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, saying, The Philistines have brought back the ark of Jehovah. Come down and bring it up to you. 

\c 7 

\v 1 So the men of Kiriathjearim came, and brought up the ark of Jehovah, and carried it into the house of Abinadab on the hill, and consecrated Eleazar his son to guard the ark of Jehovah. 

\v 2 From the time the ark began to abide in Kiriath¬jearim, many years passed, and it was twenty years. Then all the nation of Israel turned to Jehovah.

\v 3 And Samuel spoke to all the nation Israel, saying, If with all your heart you are returning to Jehovah, then put away the foreign gods and the Ashtartesm from among you and direct your hearts towards Jehovah and serve him alone that he may deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines. 

\v 4 Then the Israelites put away the Baalim and the Ashtartes, and served Jehovah only.

\v 5 And Samuel said, Assemble all Israel at Mizpah and I will intercede for you with Jehovah. 

\v 6 So they assembled at Mizpah, and drew water and poured it out before Jehovah, and fasted on that day and said, We have sinned against Jehovah. And Samuel judged th e Israelites in Mizpah. 

\v 7 And when the Philistines heard that the Israelites had assembled at Mizpah, the tyrants of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the Israelites heard it they were afraid of the Philistines.

\v 8 And the Israelites said to Samuel, Cease not to cry to Jehovah our God for us, that he will save us out of the power of the Philistines. 

\v 9 And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it as a whole burnt-offering to Jehovah ; and Samuel cried to Jehovah in behalf of Israel, and Jehovah answered him. 

\v 10 And while Samuel was offering the burnt-offering, the Philistines drew near to fight against Israel; but Jehovah thundered with a loud voice on that day against the Philistines, and threw them into confusion, and they were defeated before Israel. 

\v 11 And the men of Israel went forth from Mizpah and pursued the Philistines and smote them until they were below Bethcar.

\v 12 Then Samuel took a stone and set it between Mizpah and Yeshanag and called its name Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto hath Jehovah helped us. 

\v 13 So the Philistines were subdued and came no more within the border of Israel. And the hand of Jehovah was against the
Philistines all the days of Samuel. 

\v 14 And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel from Ekr on even to Gath; and their territory Israel delivered from the power of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.

\v 15 Now Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life. 

\v 16 And he used to go around from year to year in succession to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah; and he used to judge Israel in all those places. 

\v 17 And his return was to Ramah, for there was his home; and there he judged Israel. And there he built an altar to Jehovah.

\c 8  

\v 1 But when Samuel was old he appointed his sons judges over Israel. 

\v 2 And the name of his eldest was Joel, and the name of his second, Abijah; they were judges in Beersheba) 

\v 3 However his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after unjust gain and took bribes and perverted justice.

\v 4 Then all the elders of Israel assembled and came to Samuel at Ramah, and they said to him, See, you have become old and your sons walk not in your ways. Now appoint for us a king to and judge us like all the nations. 

\v 6 But the statement displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed to Jehovah. 

\v 7 And Jehovah said to Samuel, Listen to the voice of the people according to all that they say to thee; for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me from being king over them. 

\v 8 Like all the deeds which they have done to me since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day, in that they have forsaken me and served other gods, so also are they doing to thee.

\v 9 Now therefore hearken to their voice, except that thou shalt solemnly warn them, and shalt show them the prerogative of the king who shall reign over them.

\v 10 And Samuel told all the words of Jehovah to the people who were asking of him a king.

\v 11 And he said, This will be the prerogative of the king who shall reign over you : he will take your sons and appoint them for himself over his chariots and horsemen; and they shall run before his chariots; 

\v 12 and he shall appoint them for himself as commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, and some to plow his ground and to reap his harvest and to make his implements of war and the furnishings for his chariots. 

\v 13 And he will take your daughters to be perfumers and
to be cooks and to be bakers. 

\v 14 And of your fields and your vineyards and your oliveyards, he will take the best and give them to his servants. 

\v 15 And he will take the tithe of your grain fields and of your vineyards and give to his eunuchs and to his servants. 

\v 16 And he will take your men-servants and your maid-servants, and the best of your cattlen and your asses, and use them for his work. 

\v 17 He will take the tithe of your flocks; and you shall become his servants. 

\v 18 Then you will cry out in that day on account of your king whom you will have chosen for yourselves; but Jehovah will not answer you in that day.

\v 19 But the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel, and said, Nay, but a king shall be over us, 

\v 20 that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles. 

\v 21 And Samuel heard all the words of the people and repeated them to Jehovah. 

\v 22 And Jehovah said to Samuel, Listen to their voice and make them a king. And Samuel said to the men of Israel, Go every man to his city.

\c 9

\v 1 Now there was a man of Gibeahi, whose name was Kish the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a man well to do) 

\v 2 And he had a son whose name was Saul, a man in the prime of life and handsome; and there was not one among the Israelites more handsome than he. From his shoulders and upwards he was higher than any of the people.

\v 3 Now the she-asses of Kish, Saul's father, were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with you and arise and go seek the asses. 

\v 4 And they passed through the hill-country of Ephraim, and the land of Shalishah, but did not find them. Then they passed through the land of Shaalim, but they were not there. And they passed through the land of the Benjamites but did not find them.

\v 5 When they were. come into the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, Come, let us return, lest my father cease thinking of the asses and become anxious for us. 

\v 6 And he answered him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and the man is held in honor; all that he says is sure to come true. Now let us go thither; perhaps he can give us information regarding the mission on which we are going. 

\v 7 Then Saul said to his servant, But, suppose we go, what shall we take to the man ? for the bread is gone from our sacks, and there is no present to take to the man of God. What have we ? 

\v 8 And the servant answered Saul again, and said, See I have with me a fourth part of a silver shekel, and young shall give it to the man of God that he may furnish us information regarding our mission.

\v 9 (Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he said, Come let us go to the seer; for he who is now called a prophet was previously called a seer). 

\v 10 Then Saul said to his servant, Your advice is good; come, let us go. So they went to the city where the man of God was.

\v 11 As they were going up the ascent to the city, they met young maidens going out to draw water and said to them, Is the seer here ? 

\v 12 And they answered them and said, He is; behold he is before you. Make haste now, the for he is come to-day into the city; for the people have a sacrifice to-day on the high place. 

\v 13 As soon as you come to the city, you will at once find him before he goes up to the high place to eat; for the people will not eat until he come, for he is to bless the sacrifice; and afterwards the guests eat. Now therefore go up; for at this time you will meet him. 

\v 14 And so they went up to the city. When they came within the city gate, Samuel was just coming out toward them, to go up to the high place. 

\v 15 Now Jehovah had given to Samuel, a day before Saul came, the following revelation:

\v 16 At this time to-morrow I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin and thou shalt anoint him to be a prince over my people Israel. And he shall save my people out of the hand of the Philistines; for I have seen the afflictiong of my people and their cry has come to me. 

\v 17 And when Samuel saw Saul, Jehovah indicated to him, This is the man of whom I spoke to thee ! He it is who shall rule over my people. 

\v 18 Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, if you will, where the seer's house is. 

\v 19 And Samuel answered Saul and said, I am the seer; go up before me to the high place, for you shall eat with me to-day; and in the morning I will let you go, and will tell you all that is in your heart. 

\v 20 And as for your asses that were lost three days ago, do not trouble yourself about them for they have been found. And to whom belongs all that is desirable in Israel ? Does it not to you, and to yours father's house ? 

\v 21 And Saul answered and said, Am I not a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel, and is not my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin ? Why then do you speak thus to me ?

\v 22 And Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the hall and made them sit at the head of the guests (who were about thirty persons).

\v 23 And Samuel said to the cook, Bring the portion I gave you, which I told you to put aside. 

\v 24 And the cook took up the leg and placed it before Saul. And Samuel said, See, the meat is served ! eat ! for it was kept for you until the appointed time, that you might eat with those whom I have invited. So Saul ate with Samuel that day.

\v 25 And after they came down from the high place into the city, they spread a bed for Saul on the roof, and he lay down. 

\v 26 Then at daybreak Samuel called to Saul on the roof, saying, Up, that I may send you away. So Saul arose, and he and Samuel went out into the street. 

\v 27 As they were going down at the outskirts of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, but you stand here that I may make known to you the word of God. 

\c 10  

\v 1 Then Samuel took the vial of oil, and poured it on his head, and kissed him and said, Hath not Jehovah anointed you to be a prince over his people Israel ? And you shall reign over the people of Jehovah and deliver them from the power of their enemies around about. And this shall be the sign that Jehovah has anointed you to be a prince over his heritage:

\v 2 when you go from me to-day you shall find two men at Rachel's tomb, in the boundary of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say to you, 'The asses which you went to seek are found, and now your father has dismissed the matter of the asses and is anxious for you, saying, "What shall I do for my son?"' 

\v 3 Then you shall go on from there and come to the oak of Tabor; and there three men going up to God to Bethel will meet you, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a skin of wine. 

\v 4 And they will salute you and give you two loaves of bread which you shall take from their hand. 

\v 5 After that you shall come to Gibeah, where is the garrison of the Philistines; and furthermore when you come thither to the city, you shall meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a lyre, a tambourine, a flute, and a harp before them; and they will be prophesying. 

\v 6 And the spirit of Jehovah will rush upon you, and you shall prophesy with them and shall be turned into another man. And when these signs come to you, you shall do as the occasion offers; for God is with you.

\v 8 Now when Samuel anointed Saul, he commanded him, saying, You shall go down before me to Gilgal, and then I will come down to you, to offer burnt-offer¬ings.	Wait seven
days until I come to you and show you what you shall do.

\v 9 Accordingly when he turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart, and all those signs came to pass that day. 

\v 10 And just as he came thence to Gibeah, a band of prophets met him, and he prophesied among them. 

\v 11 And when every one who knew him saw him in the act of prophesying with the prophets, the people said to one another, What is this that has come upon the son of Kish ? Is Saul also among the prophets ? 

\v 12 And one of the bystanders answered and said, And who is their father ? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets ? 

\v 13 And when he had made an end of prophesying, he went to the high place.

\v 14 And Saul's cousin said to him and to his servant, Where did you go ? And he said, To seek the asses; and when we saw that they were not found, we went to Samuel. 

\v 15 And Saul's cousin said, Tell me, I pray, what Samuel said to you. 

\v 16 And Saul said to his cousin, He told us definitely that the asses were found. But concerning the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel had spoken, he told him nothing.

\v 17 And Samuel called the people together to Mizpah; 

\v 18 and he said to the Israelites, Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that were oppressing
you. 

\v 19 But you yourselves have this day rejected your God, who himself has been saving you from all your calamities and your distresses, and you have said to him, 'Nay, but a king shalt thou set over us.' Now therefore present yourselves before Jehovah by your tribes and by your thousands.

\v 20 So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken.

\v 21 And he brought the tribe of Benjamine near by their clans; and the clan of the Matrites was taken; and he brought near the clan of Matri man by man and Saul the son of Kish was taken; but when they sought him he could not be found. 

\v 22 Therefore they asked of Jehovah further, Did the man come hither? And Jehovah answered Behold he hath hid himself among the baggage. 

\v 23 And one ran and brought him from there. And when he stood among the people, he was taller than any of the people from his shoulders upward.

\v 24 And said Samuel to the the people, Have you seen him whom Jehovah hath chosen? for there is none like him among all the people. And all the people shouted loudly. May the king live!

\v 25 Thus Samuel revealed to the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before Jehovah. And Samuel sent all the people away, each man to his home. 

\v 26 And Saul also went to his home at Gibeah; and there went with him the brave men whose hearts God had touched. 

\v 27 But there were base scoundrels who said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no present.

\c 11 
\v 1 Now it came to pass after about a month that Nahash the Ammonite came up and besieged Jabesh in Gilead; and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, Make terms with us and we will serve you. 

\v 2 But Nahash the Am¬monite said to them, On this condition will I make terms with you : that I bore out the right eye of each of you and thereby bring a reproach upon all Israel. 

\v 3 And the elders of Jabesh said to him, Give us seven days respite, that we may send messengers through all the territory of Israel. Then if there be none to save us we will come to you.

\v 4 So the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and recounted the facts in the hearing of the people, and all the people wept aloud. 

\v 6 And Saul was just coming from the field after the oxen. And Saul said, What is the trouble with the people that they are weeping ? Then they told him the words of the men of Jabesh. 

\v 6 And the spirit of Jehovah rushed upon Saul when he heard these words, and his anger was greatly aroused. 

\v 7 And he took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the territory of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, Whoever does not come forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen. Then a terror from Jehovah fell upon the people, and they rallied as one man. 

\v 8 And he mustered them in Bezek; and the Israelites were three hun¬dred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.

\v 9 And they said to the messengers who came, Thus say to the men of Jabesh in Gilead, 'To¬morrow, by the time the sun becomes hot, deliverance shall come to you.' So the messengers came and told the men of Ja¬besh, and they were glad. 

\v 10 Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To-morrow we will come out to you, and you shall do to us whatever you please. 

\v 11 Accordingly on the following day, Saul divided the people into three divisions; and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and smote the Ammonites, until the heat of the day. And then they who remained scattered, so that no two of them were left together.

\v 12 And the people say to Samuel, Who is he who says, 'Saul shall not reign over us?' Bring the men that we may put them to death.

\v 13 And Saul said, To-day not a man shall be put to death, for to-day Jehovah hath wrought deliverance in Israel.

\v 14 Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.

\v 15 And all the people when to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before Jehovah in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed peace-offerings before Jehovah; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced exceedingly.

\c 12

\v 1 Then Samuel said to all Israel, See, I have hearkened to your voice in all that you have said to me and have appointed a king over you.

\v 2 And from now on, behold the king who will go before you; but as for me, I am old and gray, and my sons are with you: and I have walked before you from my youth to this day.

\v 3 Here am I! Testify against my before Jehovah, and before his annointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I oppressed? whom have I defrauded? or from whose hand have I taken a ransom, or a sandal ? Testify and I will restore it to you.

\v 4 And they said, You have not oppressed us, nor defrauded us, nor have you taken anything from any man's hand. 

\v 5 Therefore he said to them, Jehovah is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand. And they said, He is witness. 

\v 6  Then Samuel said to the people, Jehovah is witness, who appointed Moses and Aaron and who brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.

\v 7 Now therefore take your stand that I may declare to you before Jehovah all the righteous acts of Jehovah, which he did to you and to your fathers. 
 
\v 8 When Jacob came to Egypt, and your fathers cried to Jehovah, then Jehovah sent Moses and Aaron to bring your fathers out of Egypt, and made a them dwell in this place.

\v 9 But they forgot Jehovah their God, and he sold them into the hand of Sisera, commander of the army of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the king of Moab; and they fought against them. 

\v 10 And they cried to Jehovah and said, We have sinned because we have forsaken Jehovah and served the Baalim and the Ashtartes. But now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee. 

\v 11 And Jehovah sent Jerubbaal, and Barak, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies round about you so that you dwelt in safety.  

\v 12 And you saw that Nahash the king of the Ammonites came against you. And you said to me, 'Nay, but a king shall reign over us,' although Jehovah your God was your king.

\v 13 Now therefore see the king whom you have chosen, for Jehovah has now set a king over you.

\v 14 If you will fear Jehovah and serve him and listen to his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of Jehovah, and both you and the king who reigns over you follow Jehovah your God, well. 

\v 15 But if you will not hearken to the voice of Jehovah, but rebel against the commandment of Jehovah, then shall the hand of Jehovah be against you and your king.

\v 16 Now therefore take your stand and see this great thing, which Jehovah is about to do before your eyes. 

\v 17 Is it not wheat harvest to-day ? I will call upon Jehovah, to send thunder and rain; and you shall know and see that your wickedness is great, which you have done in the sight of Jehovah in asking you a king. 

\v 18 So Samuel called upon Jehovah, and Jehovah sent thunder and rain that day; and all the people were greatly afraid of Jehovah and Samuel.

\v 19 Then all the people said to Samuel, Intercede with Jehovah your God in behalf of your servants that we die not; for we have added to all our sins the crime of asking a king. 

\v 20 But Samuel said to the people, Fear not; you have indeed done all this evil, yet do not turn aside from following Jehovah, but serve Jehovah with all your heart; 

\v 21 and do not turn aside after vain final things which cannot profit or deliver, for they are vain. 

\v 22 For Jehovah because of his great name will not cast away his people, for Jehovah has undertaken to make you a people for himself. 

\v 23 Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against Jehovah in ceasing to intercede for you; but I will instruct you in the good and the right way. 

\v 24 Only fear Jehovah and serve him in truth with all your heart, for you see what a great thing he hath done in your presence. 

\v 25 But if you persist in doing wrong, both you and your king shall be destroyed.

\c 13

\v 2 Saul chose him three thousand men of of Israel: two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and on the mountain of Bethel and a thousand were with Jonathan his sons in Gibeah of Benjamin.  But the rest of the people he had sent each to his home.

\v 3 Then Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Gibeah. And the Philistines heard the report, The Hebrews have revolted. But Saul had meantime caused the trumpet to be blown throughout all the land.

\v 4 And all Israel heard the report, Saul has smitten the garrison of the Philistines, and also Israel has brought itself into ill odor with the Philistines. And the Philistines were gathered together to fight with Israel. 

\v 5 And the Philistines were gathered together to fight with Israel — thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen and people

\v 6 as numerous as the sand on the sea. And they came up and encamped in Michmash, east of Beth¬aven. When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were hard pressed), the people hid themselves in caves, in holes, in rocks, in tombs, and in pits. 

\v 7 Also many people went over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. But Saul was still in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.

\v 8 And he waited seven days for the appointed time which Samuel had set; but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the people scattered away from him. 

\v 9 Therefore Saul said, Bring here to me the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings. And he offered the burnt-offer¬ing. 

\v 10 And then, just as he had finished offering the burnt-offering, Sam¬uel came; and Saul went out to greet him) 

\v 11 But Samuel said, What have you done ? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattering away from me and you did not come within the appointed time, and the Philistines were gather¬ing together at Mich-mash, 

\v 12 I said, 'Now will the Philistines come down to me at Gilgal, and I shall not have appeased Jehovah.' So I con¬strained myself and of¬fered the burnt-offering. 

\v 13 Then Samuel said to Saul, You have acted foolishly. If you had kept the command of Je¬hovah your God, which he commanded you, then would Jehovah have es¬tablished your kingdom over Israel forever. 

\v 14 But now your kingdom shall not continue. Jehovah hath sought out a man after his own heart, and Jehovah hath appointed him a leader over his peo¬ple, because you have not kept that which Je¬hovah commanded you. 

\v 15 Then Samuel arose and went up from Gilgal and proceeded on his way to Gibeah of Benjamin.

\v 15 And Saul numbered the people who were with him, about six hundred men. 

\v 16 And Saul and Jonathan his son, together with the people who were with them, were staying in Gibeah of Benjamin, while the Philistines encamped in Michmash. 

\v 17 And the plunderers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three divisions: one division turned in the direction of Ophrah in the land of Shual, 

\v 18 and another division turned in the direction of Bethhoron, and another division turned in the direction of the hill that looks down over the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.

\v 19 Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel, for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make sword or speak;

\v 20 but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines to sharpen each his plowshare and his coulter and his ax and his mattock ; 

\v 21 yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters and for the forks and for the axes and to set the ox-goads.. 

\v 22 So it came to pass on the day of Michmash that none of the people with Saul and Jonathan had either sword or spear ; but Saul and Jonathan his son had them. 

\v 23 And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash. 

\c 14  

\v 1 Now on that day Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who bore his armor, Come and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other side. But he did not tell his father. 

\v 2 And Saul was sitting in the outskirts of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree which is by the thresh¬ing-floor, and the people who were with him numbered about six hundred men. 

\v 3 And Ahijah the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of Jehovah at Shiloh, was in charge of an ephod. And the people did not know that Jonathan had gone. 

\v 4 And between the passes by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines' garrison there was a rocky crag on the one side, and a rocky crag on the other side; and the name of the one was Bozez [the Shining], and the name of the other Seneh [the Thorny]. 

\v 5 The one crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba. 

\v 6 And Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, Come, let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised Philistines; perhaps Jehovah will act for us, for there is nothing that can prevent Jehovah from saving by many or by few. 

\v 7 And his armorbearer said to him, Do whatever your judgment dictates; see I am with you; your wish is mine. 

\v 8 Then Jonathan said, See, we will pass over to the men and show ourselves to them. 

\v 9 If they say to us, 'Stand still until we can reach you,' then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up to them. 

\v 10 But if they say, 'Come up to us,' then we will go up; for Jehovah has given them into our hand; and this shall be the sign to us. 

\v 11 Now when both of them showed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines, the Philistines said, There are Hebrews coming out of the holes where they have hidden themselves. 

\v 12 And the men of the garrison cried out to Jonathan and his armorbearer, saying, Come up to us that we may tell you something. Then Jonathan said to his armorbearer, Come up after me; for Jehovah has given them into the hand of Israel. 

\v 13 And Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, and his armorbearer after him. And they fell before Jonathan, and his armorbearer kept despatching them after him. 

\v 14 And in the first attack Jonathan and his armorbearer slew about twenty men with javelins and rocks from the field.

\v 15 And there was a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people; the garrison, and even the raiders also trembled; and the earth quaked so that it produced a supernatural panic.

\v 16 And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and saw a tumult surging hither and thither.

\v 17 Then said Saul to the people who were with him, Investigate now and see who is gone from us. And when they had investigated they found that Jonathan and his armorbearer were not there. 

\v 18 And Saul said to Ahijah, Bring hither the ephod; for at that time he had charge of the ephod before Israel. 

\v 19 And while Saul was yet speaking to the priest, the tumult in the camp of the Philistines kept on increasing. Therefore Saul said to the priest, Draw back your hand. 

\v 20 And Saul and all the people that were with him responded to the call, and came to the battle; and thereupon every man's sword was turned upon his fellow and there was very great confusion. 

\v 21 And the Hebrews, who were with the Philistines heretofore, who had come up into the camp, also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan. 

\v 22 Likewise all the men of Israel, who were in hiding in the hill-country of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, also pursued close after them in the battle. 

\v 23 So Jehovah saved Israel that day, and the battle passed over beyond Bethhoron. And all the people were with Saul, about ten thousand men; and the fighting was scattered over all the hill-country of Ephraim. 

\v 24 Then Saul committed a great act of folly that day, for he laid an oath on the people, saying, Cursed is the man who shall eat any food until evening and until I avenge myself on my enemies. So none of the people tasted food. 

\v 25 Now there was honey on the surface of the ground,

\v 26 and when the people came to the honeycomb, the bees had just flown away, but no one put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath. 

\v 27 But Jonathan had not heard when his father adjured the people; therefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb and put his hand to his mouth, and his eyes were lightened. 

\v 28 Then spoke up one of the people and said, Your father adjured the people saying, 'Cursed be the man who eats food this day.' But the people were exhausted. 

\v 29 Then said Jonathan, My father has brought disaster on the land. See how I have been refreshed, because I tasted a little of this honey. 

\v 30 If only the people had eaten freely to-day of the spoil of their enemies which they found, how much greater would have been the slaughter of the Philistines!

\v 31 But they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon, and the people were very faint. 

\v 32 Then the people rushed upon the spoil and took sheep and oxen and calves and struck them to the earth, and the people ate them with the blood. 

\v 33 When they told Saul, saying, See, the people are sinning against Jehovah in eating with the blood, he said to those who told him, Roll hither to me a great stone. 

\v 34 And Saul said, Go out among the people and say to them, 'Let each man bring to me his ox and his sheep, and slay it here and eat; but do not sin against Jehovah in eating the flesh together with the blood. And all the people brought that night, each what he had in his hand, and slew them there. 

\v 35 So Saul built an altar to Jehovah; that was the first altar that he built to Jehovah.

\v 36 And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night and plunder amongw them until daybreak, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatever you think best. Then said the priest, Let us here draw near to God. 

\v 37 And Saul asked of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? Wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he did not answer him that day. 

\v 38 And Saul said, Come hither, all you chiefs of the people and know and see in whom is this guilt to-day. 

\v 39 For as Jehovah liveth, who delivereth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But no one of all the people answered him. 

\v 40 Then he said to all Israel, You be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said to Saul, Do what seems good to you. 

\v 41 Therefore Saul said, Jehovah, God of Israel, why hast thou not answered thy servant this day? If the guilt be in me or in Jonathan my son, Jehovah, God of Israel, give Urim; but if the guilt is in thy people Israel, give Thummim. a Then Jonathan and Saul were taken and the people escaped. 

\v 42 And Saul said, Cast the lot between me and Jonathan my son. He whom Jehovah shall take, must die. And the people said to Saul, It shall not be so! But Saul overruled the people and they cast the lot between him and Jonathan his son. And Jonathan was taken.

\v 43 Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what you have done. And Jonathan told him saying, I did indeed taste a little honey with the end of the staff that was in my hand; and here I am! I am ready to die.

\v 44  "And Saul said, May God do to me whatever he pleases, you shall surely die, Jonathan !

\v 45 But the people said to Saul, Shall Jonathan die who has wrought this great deliverance in Israel ? Far from it ! As Jehovah liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground, for he has wrought with God this day. Therefore the people redeemed Jonathan, so that he did not die. Then Saul went up from pursuing the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own country.

\v 47 Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he saes fought against all his enemies on every side: against Moab and the Ammonites and Edom and Beth-rehob,s the king of Zobah and the Philistines; and wherever he turned he was victorious.t

\v 48 And he did mighty deeds and smote the Amalekites and delivered Israel out of the hands of its plunderers.
"
\v 49 Now the sons of Saul were: Jonathan, Ishbaal, and Malchishua. And His these are the names of his two daughters: the eldest, Merab, the youngest, Michal. 

\v 50 And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the commander of his army was Abner the son of Ner, Saul's cousin. 

\v 51 And Kish the father of Saul and Ner the father of Abner were sons of Abiel.

\v 52 But the war against the Philistines was severe all the days of Saul. And whenever Saul saw any valiant or efficient man, he would attach him to himself.

\c 15 

\v 1 1And Samuel said to Saul, Jehovah sent	me to anoint you to be king over his people Israel. Now therefore listen to the words of Jehovah. 

\v 2 Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, 'I have determined tes to punish that which Amalek did to Israel, in that he opposed him in the way, when he came up out of Egypt. 

\v 3 Now go and smite Amalek and utterly destroy him and all that he has, and spare him not, but slay both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and ass.

\v 4 And Saul summoned the people and mus¬tered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen and ten thousand men of Judah. 

\v 5 And when Saul came to the city of Amalek, he lay in wait in the valley. 

\v 6 And Saul said to the Ken¬ites, Go away, withdraw from among the Amale¬kites, lest I destroy you with them, for you showed kindness to all the Israelites when they came up from Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites. 

\v 7 And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah as far as Shur, which is before Egypt. 

\v 8 And he took Agag the king of Amalek alive and completely destroyed all the people with the sword. 

\v 9 But Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep, the oxen, the fatlings, the lambs, and all that was good, and would not completely destroy them; but everything that was worthless and despised, that they completely destroyed.

\v 10 Then the word of Jehovah came to Samuel saying, 

\v 11 I repent that I have made Saul king, for he has turned from following me and has not carried out my commands. And Samuel was angry and cried to Jehovah all night. 

\v 12 And early in the morning Samuel rose to meet Saul. Then Samuel was told, Saul came to Carmel and has just set up a monument and has turned and passed on and gone down to Gilgal. 

\v 13 And when Samuel came to Saul, Saul said to him, Blessed be thou of Jehovah ! I have fulfilled the command of Jehovah. 

\v 14 And Samuel said, What then is this bleating of the sheep in my ears and the lowing of the cattle which I hear ? 

\v 15 And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites, for the people spared the best ofl the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice to Jehovah your God; and the rest we have completely de¬stroyed. 

\v 16 Then Samuel said to Saul, Stop ! and let me tell you what Jehovah hath said to me this night. And he said to him, Speak. 

\v 17 And Samuel said, Though you are little in your own sight, are you not the head of the tribes of Israel ? And Jehovah anointed you king over Israel, 

\v 18 and Jehovah sent you on an expedition and said, ' Go, and completely destroy the sinners of Amalek and fight against them until they are consumed.' 

\v 19 Why then did you not obey the voice of Jehovah and why did you swoop upon the spoil and displease Jehovah ? 

\v 20 And Saul said to Samuel, I have obeyed the voice of Je¬hovah and have gone on the expedition upon which Jehovah sent me and have brought back Agag the king of the Amalekites and have com¬pletely destroyed the Amalekites. 

\v 21 But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the best of the things which were placed under the ban to sacrifice to Jehovah your God in Gilgal. 

\v 22 And Samuel said, Does Jehovah delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices as in obedience to the voice of Jehovah ? Behold to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. For rebellion is as bad as the sin of divination, and obstinacy as the iniquity of the teraphim. Because you have rejected the word of Jehovah,
He hath rejected you from being king.

\v 24 And Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned, for I have transgressed the command of Jehovah and your words because I feared the people and listened to their voice. 

\v 25 Now therefore pardon for my sin and turn back with me, that I may worship Jehovah. 

\v 26 But Samuel said to Saul, I will not turn back with you, for you have rejected the word of Jehovah and Jehovah hath rejected you from being king over Israel. 

\v 27 And as Samuel turned to go away, Saul seized the skirt of his robe, but it tore.

\v 28 Then Samuel said to him, Jehovah hath to-day torn the kingdom of Israel from you and hath given it to your neighbor who is better than you.

\v 29 Moreover the GloryP of Israel will not lie nor repent; for he is not a man that he should repent.

\v 30 Then he said, I have sinned, yet honor me now at least before the elders of my people and before Israel, and turn back with me, that I may worship Jehovah your God. 

\v 31 So Samuel turned back and followed Saul, while Saul worshipped Jehovah.

\v 32 Then Samuel said, Bring here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. Fate of And Agag came to him trembling. And Agag said, Surely death is bitter. 

\v 33 And Samuel said, As your sword has bereaved women, so shall your mother be the most bereaved of women. Thereupon Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before Jehovah in Gilgal. 

\v 34 Then Samuel went to Ramah, but Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul. 

\v 35 And Samuel saw Saul no more until the day of his death, for Samuel grieved over Saul. Now Jehovah repented that he had made Saul king over Israel, 

\c 16

\v 1 and Jehovah said to Samuel, How long wilt thou grieve over Saul, when I have rejected him from being Samuel
king over Israel ? Fill thy horn with oil and
go. I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite ; for I have provided me a king among his sons. 

\v 2 And Samuel said, How can I go, since Saul will hear of it and kill me ? But Jehovah said, Take a calf with thee and say, ' To sacrifice to Jehovah am I come!' 

\v 3 And invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show thee what thou shalt do, and anoint him whom I name to thee. 

\v 4 And Samuel did that which Jehovah had commanded. And when he came to Bethlehem, the elders of the city came trembling to meet him and said, Does your coming betoken good ? 

\v 6 And he said Yes, to sacrifice to Jehovah am I come. Puri¬fy yourselves and rejoiced with me in the sac¬rifice. And he purified Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice. 

\v 6 And when they came and he saw Eliab, he said, Surely in Jehovah's presence is his anointed. 

\v 7 But Jehovah said to Samuel, Look not on his ap¬pearance or on the height of his stature, since I have rejected him; for Jehovah doth not seer as man sees, for man looks on the outward appearance, but Jehovah looks at the heart. 

\v 8 Then Jesse called Abinadab, and brought him before Samuel. But he said, Neither hath Jehovah chosen this one. 

\v 9 Then Jesse brought forward Shammah. But he said, Neither hath Jehovah chosen this one. 

\v 10 Then Jesse brought his seven sons before Samuel. But Samuel said to Jesse, Jehovah hath not chosen these. 

\v 11 And Samuel said to Jesse, Are these all the young men ? And he said, There is still the youngest, and he is a shepherd with the flock. Therefore Samuel said to Jesse, Send and bring him, for we will not sit down until he is brought here. 

\v 12 So he sent and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, a youth with beau¬tiful eyes and attractive appearance. And Jehovah said, Arise, anoint him, for he it is. 

\v 13 Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers. And the spirit of Jehovah came with power upon David from that day forward. And Samuel arose and went to Ramah.

\v 14 Now the spirit of Jehovah had de¬parted from Saul and an evil spirit from Jehovah tor¬mented him. 

\v 15 And Saul's servants said to him, See now, an evil spirit from Je¬hovah is tormenting you. 

\v 16 Let your servants who are before you speak and they will seek for our lord a man skilful in playing the lyre. Then whenever the evil spirit comes upon you he shall play with his hand, and you will be better. 

\v 17 Then Saul said to his servants, Provide me now a man who plays well, and bring him to me. 

\v 18 Thereupon one of the young men answered and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehem¬ite who is skilful in playing and a valiant man, a soldier, judicious in speech, a man of good appearance, and Je¬hovah is with him. 

\v 19 There¬fore Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, Send me David your son, who is with the flock. 

\v 20 And Jesse took ten loaves g of bread, and a skin of wine, and a kid, and sent them to Saul by David his son. 

\v 21 So David came to Saul and entered his service ; and he loved him so much that he became one of his armorbearers. 

\v 22 And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David enter my service, for he has found favor in my sight. 

\v 23 And whenever the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, David would take the lyre and play with his hand and Saul would breathe freely and would feel better and the evil spirit would depart from him.

\c 17

\v 1 Now the Philistines mustered together their forces for war, and they were gathered together at Socoh, which belongs
to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes¬dammim. 

\v 2 And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered to¬gether and encamped in the val¬ley of Elah; and they drew up in battle-array against the Philis¬tines. 

\v 3 And the Philistines were standing on the mountain on the one side, and the Israelites were standing on the mountain on the other side, and the valley was between them. 

\v 4 And there came out a champion from the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath of Gath, whose height was about ten feet. 

\v 5 And he had a helmet of bronze upon his head, and he was clad with a bronze breast¬plate of scales, the weight of which was about two hundred pounds.

\v 6 And he had greaves of bronze upon his legs and a javelin of bronze between his shoulders. 

\v 7 And the shaft of his spear was like a weaver's beam, and the head of his iron spear weighed twenty-four pounds; and his shield-bearer went before him 

\v 8 And he stood and cried out to the ranks of Israel and said to them, Why have you come out to draw up the line of battle ? Am not I a Philistine and you Saul's servants ? Choose a man for yourselves and let him come down to me. 

\v 9 If he be able to fight with me and kill me, then will we be your servants; but if I prevail against him and kill him, then shall you be our servants and serve us. 

\v 10 And the Philistine said, I have insulted the ranks of Israel to-day; give me a man that we may fight to¬gether. 

\v 11 And when Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were terrified and greatly afraid.

\v 12 Now David was the son of an Ephrathite of Bethlehem in Judah, whose name was Jesse, and he had eight sons. And the man was old in the days of Saul, advanced in years among men. 

\v 13 And the three eldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the war; and the names of his three sons who went to the war were Eliab the eldest, his second Abinadab, and the
third Shammah. 

\v 14 But David was the youngest; and the three eldest had followed Saul. 

\v 15 Now David went to and fro from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem. 

\v 16 And the Philistine drew near morning and evening and took his stand forty days. 

\v 17 And Jesse said to David his son, Take now for your brothers a bushel of this parched grain and these ten loaves and carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers. 

\v 18 But bring these ten cheeses to the commander of the thousand and look after your brothers' welfare and take a definite assurance from them. 

\v 19 Now Saul and they and all the men of Israel are in the valley of Elah fighting with the Philistines.

\v 20 So David rose up early in the morning and left the flock with a keeper and went, as Jesse had commanded him. And he came to the entrenchments just as the army was going forth to the battle-array, shouting the war cry. 

\v 21 And Israel and the Philistines drew up the line of battle, army confronting army. 

\v 22And David left his vessels in the charge of the keeper of the baggage and ran to the line of battle and came and asked for the wel¬fare of his brothers. 

\v 23 And just as he was talking with them, the champion, the Phi¬listine of Gath, Goliath by name, came up out of the ranks of the Philistines and spoke the same words as before; and David heard them. 

\v 24 24And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him and were greatly afraid. 

\v 25 And the men of Israel said, Have you seen this man who has come up ? Surely to in¬sult Israel has he come up. Whoever smites him, the king will greatly enrich and will give him his daughter also and will make his father's house free in Israel.

\v 26 Then David spoke to the men who stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man who smites that Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel ? For who is this uncir¬cumcised Philistine, that he has dared to insult the armies of the living God ? 

\v 27 And the people answered him in the words just given, saying, Thus shall it be done to the man who smites him. 

\v 28 But Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why have you come down? And with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know you well and the wickedness of your heart; for to see the battle you have come down.

\v 29 And David said, What have I now done? Is it not a matter of importance? 

\v 30 And turning away from him to another, he spoke as before; and the people answered him again as at the first time.

\v 31 And when the words were heard which David spoke, they reported them to Saul. And they took him and brought him before Saul.

\v 32 But David said to Saul, Let not my lord's courage fail him; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine. 

\v 33 And Saul said to David, you are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him, for you are only a youth and he has been a warrior from his youth. 

\v 34 But David said to Saul, Your servant was a shepherd with his father's flock; and when a lion, or a bear would come and take a lamb out of the flock, 

\v 35 would go out after him and smite him and deliver it from his mouth; and if he rose up against me, I would seize him by his beard and slay him with a blow.

\v 36 Your servant smote both lion and bear. Now this uncircumcised Philistine shall be like one of them, since he has insulted the armies of the living God.

\v 37 David also said, Jehovah who delivered me from the paw of the lion, and from the paw of the bear, will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine. Therefore Saul said to David, Go, and may Jehovah be with you.

\v 38 And Saul clothed David with his garments, and put a helmet of bronze on his head and clad him with a coat of mail.

\v 39 And David girded his sword over his coat and made a vain attempt to go, for he had not tried them. Then David said to Saul, I cannot go with these for I have not tried them. And David put them off him.

\v 40 And he took his club in his hand, and chose five smooth stones out of the brook and put them in his bag, and took his sling in his hand, and he drew near to the Philistine.

\v 41 But the Philistine kept coming nearer to David, and the man who was bearing the shield went before him.

\v 42 And when the Philistine looked and saw David, he despised him, for he was but a youth and ruddy, a young man of attractive ap¬pearance.

\v 43 And the Philistine said to David, Am I a dog that you come to me with a club ? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. 

\v 44 And the Philistine said to David, Come to me that I may give your flesh to the birds of the heavens and to the beasts of the field. 

\v 45 Then David answered the Philistine, You come to me with a sword and a spear and a javelin, But I come to you in the name of Jehovah of hosts, and the God of the ranks of Israel whom you have insulted.

\v 46 To-day Jehovah will deliver you into my hands, That I may smite you and cut off your head; and I will this day give the dead of the army of the Phi¬listines to the birds of the heavens and to the wild beasts of the earth, that all the world may know that there is a God in Israel, 

\v 47 And that all this assembly may know that not with the sword and spear doth Jehovah save, for the battle is Jehovah's and he will give you into our hand.

\v 48  Then when the Philistine arose and came and drew near to meet David, David quickly ran toward the line of battle to meet the Philistine.

\v 49 David put his hand in his bag and took from it a stone and slung it and smote the Philistine on his forehead; and the stone sank into his forehead, so that he fell on his face to the earth. 

\v 50 And David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone and smote the Philis¬tine, and slew him, although there was no sword in David's hand.

\v 51 Then David ran and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of its sheath,. and slew him, and cut off his head with it. And when the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled. 

\v 52 And the men of Israel and Judah arose and raised the battle cry and pursued the Philistines to the entrance to Gath and to the gates of Ekron, so that the wounded of the Philis¬tines fell down on the way from Shaaraim, even to Gath and Ekron. 

\v 53 And when the Israelites re¬turned from pursuing the Philistines, they plun¬dered their camp, 

\v 54 but David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem; and he put his armor in his tent.

\v 55 And when Saul saw David going out against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the commander of the army, Abner, whose son is this lad ? And Abner said, As you live, O king, I cannot tell. 

\v 56 And the king said, Inquire whose son the young man is. 

\v 57  And when David returned from smiting the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the Philistine's head in his hand. 

\v 58 And Saul said to him, Whose son are you, my lad ? And David answered, I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.

\c 18

\v 1 Now when David had ceased speaking with Saul, the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathon loved him as his own life. 

\v 2 And Saul took him that day and would not let him re¬turn to his father's house. 

\v 3 And Jonathan made a covenant with David, be¬cause he loved him as his own life. 

\v 4 And Jonathan stripped himself of the cloak which he had on and gave it to David and his military coat, even to his sword and to his bow and to his girdle. 

\v 5 And David went out ; in all for which Saul sent him, he acted wisely and with success, so that Saul ap¬pointed him over the warriors. And he was be¬loved alike by all the peo¬ple and by the servants of Saul.

\v 6 Now when they came back, as David returned from slaying the Philistine, the women came out dancing from all the cities of Israel to meet Saul the king with tambourines, with cries of rejoicing, and with cymbals.

\v 7 And the women sang to each other as they danced, and said, Saul has slain his thousands,but David his ten thousands.

\v 8 And it made Saul very angry, and this saying dis¬pleased him and he said, They ascribed to David ten thousands, while to me they ascribed but thousands, and what can he have more but the king¬dom? 

\v 8 And Saul kept his eye on David from that day forward. 

\v 12 And Saul was afraid of David, because Jehovah was with him and had de¬parted from Saul.  

\v 13 Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his commander over a thousand; and he went out and came in at the head of the people. 

\v 14 And David acted wisely and prospered a in all his ways, for Jeho¬vah was with him. 

\v 15 And when Saul saw that he acted wisely and prospered, he stood in dread of him. 

\v 16 But all Israel and Judah loved David, for he went out and came in at their head.

\v 17 And Saul said to David, See my oldest daughter, Merab, her will I give to you as wife; only be a valiant champion and fight Jehovah's battles. For Saul said to himself, Let not my hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him. 

\v 18 And David re¬plied to Saul, Who am I, and what is my father's clan in Israel, that I should be the king's son-in-law ? 

\v 19 But when the time came that Merab, Saul's daughter, should have been given to David, she was given as wife to Adriel e the Meholathite. 

\v 20 Michal, Saul's daughter, also loved David. And when they told Saul, he was pleased.

\v 21 And Saul said I will give her to him, that she a snare to him and that the hand of the Philistines may be upon him. Therefore Saul said to David, you shall this day be my son-in-law a second time. 

\v 22 So Saul commanded his servants, say¬ing, Communicate with David secretly and say, `See, the king is pleased with you and all his servants love you; now therefore become the king's son-in-law.' 

\v 23 And Saul's servants spoke these words in the ears of David. And David said, Is it an easy thing in your opinion to be¬come the king's son-in-law, when I am a poor man and of no reputation ? 

\v 24 And the servants of Saul told him saying, David spoke thus. 

\v 25 And Saul said, Thus shall you say to David, 'The king desires no bride-price, but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, in order to take vengeance on the king's enemies.' But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines. 

\v 26 And when his servants told David these words, David was well pleased with the prospect of being the king's son-in-law. And the days were not yet expired; and David arose and went together with his men and slew of the Philistines a hundred men; and David brought their foreskins and paid them in full to the king, in order to become the king's son-in-law. There¬fore Saul gave him Michal his daughter as wife. 

\v 28 And when Saul saw and knew that Jehovah was with David and that all Israel loved him, 

\v 29 Saul feared David still more.

\v 30 And the princes of the Philistines went forth; and as often as they went forth, David acted more wisely and with greater success than all the servants of Saul, so that his name was held in high repute.

\c 19

\v 1 And Saul commanded Jonathan his son and all his servants to put David to death. But Jonathan, Saul's
son, was very fond of David. 

\v 2 And Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father is seeking to put you to death; now there¬fore, I pray you, take care in the morning and stay in conceal¬ment and hide yourself. 

\v 3 And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will converse re¬garding you with my father, and whatever I see I will tell you.

\v 4 And Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father, and said to him, Let not the king sin against his servant David, because he has not sinned against you and because his conduct toward you has been exceedingly good; for he took his life in his hand and smote the Philis¬tine, and Jehovah wrought a great deliverance for Israel. You saw it and rejoiced. Why then will you sin against innocent blood, in slaying David without a cause ? 

\v 6 And Saul harkened to the voice of Jonathan; and Saul gave an oath, As Jehovah liveth, he shall not be put to death. 

\v 7 And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan made known to him all these words. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, so that he was again in his presence as formerly. 

\v 8 But when there was war again, David went out and fought against the Philistines, and slew great numbers of them, so that they fled before him. 

\v 9 Then an evil spirit from Jehovah came upon Saul, while he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand, and David was playing on the lyre. 

\v 10 And Saul sought to pin David to the wall with the spear, but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, so that he smote the spear into the wall, and David fled and escaped.

\v 11 And that night Saul sent messengers to David's house to watch him, so as to kill him in the morning. But Michal, David's wife, told him, saying, If you do not save your life to-night, to-morrow you will be slain. 

\v 12 Michal let David down through the window; and he fled away and escaped. 

\v 13 And Michal took the household god and laid it in the bed, and put a cloth of goat's hair for its head and covered it with the garment. 

\v 14 And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick. 

\v 15 Then Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may put him to death. 

\v 16 And when the messengers came in, there the household god was in the bed, with the cloth of goat's hair for its pillow. 

\v 17 And Saul said to Michal, Why have you deceived me thus, and let my enemy go, so that he has escaped ? And Michal answered Saul, He said to me, 'Let me go; why should I kill you ?'

\v 18 Now David fled and escaped and came to Samuel to Ramah and told aSrintauel him all that Saul had done to mah him. And he and Samuel went and remained in Nai¬oth.

\v 19 And when it was told Saul, saying, David is there at Naioth in Ramah, 

\v 20 Saul sent messengers to take David. But when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying with Samuel standing as head over them, the spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, so that they also prophe¬sied. 

\v 21 And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also proph¬esied. 

\v 22 Then Saul's anger was aroused and he himself went to Ramah. And when he came to the cistern of the threshing floor, which is on the bare height, he asked, saying, Where are Samuel and David ? And one said, There they are at Naioth in Ramah. 

\v 23 But when he went thither to Naioth in Ramah, the spirit of God also came upon him, and he went along prophesying, until he came to Naioth in Ramah. 

\v 24 And he also stripped off his clothes and prophesied before Samuel, and lay naked all that day and all that night. Therefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?

\c 20

\v 1 Then David came and said before Jonathan, What have I done ? What is my guilt ? And what is my sin before your father, that he is seeking my life ? 

\v 2 And he replied to him, Far be it! You shall not die. See, my father does nothing great or small, but that he discloses it to than me; and why should my father hide this from me ? Not so. 

\v 3 And David answered and said, Your father well knows that I have found favor in your eyes, and he is saying to himself, 'Let not Jonathan know this lest he be pained.' Nevertheless as surely as Jehovah liveth, and as you live, there is but a step between me and death. 

\v 4 Then Jonathan said to David, What do you desire to have me do for you ? 

\v 5 And David answered Jonathan, Behold, to-morrow is the new moon and I should not fail to sit at the table with the king; therefore let me go and I will hide myself in the field until evening. 

\v 6 If your father misses me, then say, 'David urgently asked leave of me to run to Bethlehem his city; for the yearly sacrifice is there for all the family.' 

\v 7 If he says 'Good,' then it is well with your servant; but if it arouses his anger, then know that evil is determined upon by him. 

\v 8 Now deal kindly with your servant, for you have brought your servant into a sacred covenant with yourself ; but if there be guilt in me, slay me yourself, for why should you bring me to your father ? 

\v 9 And Jonathan said, Far be it from you ! for if I should learn that my father had determined that evil should come upon you, I would tell you. 

\v 11 Then David said to Jonathan, Who will tell me, if your father answers me harshly ? And Jonathan re¬plied to David, Come, and let us go out into the field. So the two of them went out into the field.

\v 12 And Jonathan said to David, Jehovah, the God of Israel, be witness that I will sound my father about this time to-morrow and if he be well disposed toward David, then I will send and disclose it to you.

\v 13 God do to Jonathan whatever he will, should my father be disposed to do you evil, and I disclose it not to you and send you away that you may go in peace. And may Jehovah be with you, as he has been with my father. 

\v 14 And if I am yet alive, O may you show me the kindness of Jehovah ! But if I should die, 

\v 15 may you never withdraw your kindness from my house. And if, when Jehovah hath cut off the enemies of David, every one from the face of the earth, 

\v 16 the name of Jonathan should be cut off by the house of David, may Jehovah require it at the hand of David's enemies.

\v 17 So Jonathan took oath again to David, because of his love to him; for with all his heart he loved him.

\v 18 Then Jonathan said to him, To-morrow is the new moon and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty. 

\v 19 And on the third day you will be greatly missed. Then you shall come to the place where you hid yourself on the day of the affair, and you shall sit down there beside the heap of stones. 

\v 20 And on the third day I will shoot arrows on one side of it, as though I shot at a mark. 

\v 21 Then I will send the lad, saying, 'Go, find the arrows.'  If I say to the lad, 'See, the arrows are on this side of you; pick them up!' --- then come; for it is well for you, and, as Jehovah liveth, there is nothing the matter. 

\v 22 But if I say to the boy, 'See, the arrows are beyond you,', go, for then Jehovah sends you away.

\v 23 And as to the word which you and I have spoken, behold, Jehovah is witness between you and me forever.

\v 24 So David hid himself in the field; and when the new moon came, the king sat down at the table to eat. 

\v 25 And the king sat upon his seat as usual, even on the seat by the wall, and Jonathan sat opposite, and Abner sat by Saul's side; but David's place was empty.

\v 26 Nevertheless Saul did not say anything that day, for he thought, It is an accident, he is not ceremonially clean, for he has not been cleansed.

\v 27 But when on the day following the new moon, David's place was empty, Saul said to Jonathan his son, Why has not the son of Jesse come to the meal, either yesterday or to-day ? 

\v 28 And Jonathan answered Saul, David urgently asked leave of me to go to Bethle¬hem, 

\v 29 for he said, ' Let me go, since our family has a sacrifice in the city; and my brothers have commanded me. Now if I have found favor in your sight, let me slip away and see my kinsmen.' Hence he has not come to the king's table. 

\v 30 Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, Son of a depraved woman ! Do I not know that you are associated withg the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of your mother's nakedness ? 

\v 31 For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, neither you nor your kingdom will be established. Therefore now send and bring him to me, for he is doomed to die.

\v 32 Then Jonathan answered Saul his father and said to him, Why should he be put to death ? What has he done ? 

\v 33 But Saul lifted up his spear at him to smite him. So Jonathan knew that his father had determined to put David to death. 

\v 34 There¬fore Jonathan rose from the table in hot anger and ate no food the second day of the month, for he was grieved for David, because his father reviled him.

\v 35 But in the morning Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him. 

\v 36 And he said to his lad, Run, find
view now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him. 

\v 37 And when the lad came to the place where the arrow which Jonathan had shot lay, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond you ? 

\v 38 And Jonathan cried after the lad, Hurry, quick, do not stop ! So Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and brought them to his master. 

\v 39 But the lad had no knowledge of anything; only Jonathan and David understood the matter. 

\v 40 And Jonathan gave his weapons to his lad, and said to him, Go, carry them to the city. 

\v 41 And as soon as the lad had gone, David rose from beside the stone heap, and fell on his face to the ground and prostrated himself three times, and they kissed each other and wept at length with each other. 

\v 42 Then Jonathan said to David, Go in peace! As to what we two have sworn in the name of Jeho¬vah—Jehovah will be between me and you and between my descendants and your descendants forever. Then David rose and departed and Jonathan went into the city.

\c 21

\v 1 And David came to Nob, to AhimeLech the priest. And Ahimelech came trembling to meet David and said to him, Why
are you alone and no one with you ? 

\v 2 And David answered Ahimelech the priest, The king has entrusted me with a matter and has said to me, ' Let no one know anything about the matter upon which I am sending you and which I have commanded you;' and I have directed the young men to meet me at a certain place. 

\v 3 Now, therefore, if you have five loaves of bread at hand, or what¬ever can be found,m give it to me. 

\v 4 And the priest answered David, saying, There is no ordinary bread at hand, but there is holy bread, if only the young men have kept them¬selves from women.' 

\v 5 And David answered the priest and said to him, Of a truth women have been kept from us; as always when I set out on an expedition, the weapons of the young men were consecrated, though it is but an ordinary journey; how much more then to-day shall their weapons be holy!

\v 6 So the priest gave him holy bread, for there was no bread there but the showbread, that was taken from before Jehovah in order to put hot bread there the day it was taken away. 

\v 7 Now one of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before Jehovah, by the name of Doeg, an Edomite, the chief of Saul's herdsmen.

\v 8 And David said to Ahimelech, Have you not here at hand a spear or sword ? For I brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's matter required haste. 

\v 8 And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you slew in the valley of Elah, there it is wrapped in a garment behind the ephod. If you wish to take that, take it, for there is no other except that here. And David said, There is none like that, give it to me.

\c 22

\v 1 David therefore departed thence and escaped to the strongholds of Adullam. And when his brethren and all his father's clan heard it, they went down there to him. 

\v 2 And every one who was in distress, and every one who was in debt, and every one who was embittered gathered about him, and he became their leader. And there were with him about four hundred men.

\v 3 And David went from there to Mizpeh in Moab; and he said to the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother dwell with you, until I know what God will do for me. 

\v 4 And he left them in the presences of the king of Moab; and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the stronghold. 

\v 5 And the prophet Gad said to David, Do not remain in Mizpeh;d depart and come into the land of Judah. Then David departed and came into the forest of Hereth.

\v 6 Now when Saul heard that David and the men with him were discovered (Saul was sitting in Gibeah, under the tamarisk-tree on the high place, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him),

\v 7 Saul said to his servants who were standing before him, Hear O Benjamites! Will the son of Jesse likewise give you all fields and vineyards ? Will he make you all commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, 

\v 8 that all of you have conspired against me, and no one discloses to me that my son has made a covenant with the son of Jesse, and none of you has pity g upon me or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my servant to be an enemy against me,h as is now the case ? 

\v 9 Then Doeg the Edomite, who was standing by the servants of Saul, answered. and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub. 

\v 19 And he inquired of Godi for him and gave him provisions and the sword of Goliath the Philistine.

\v 11 Then the king summoned Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests who were in Nob, and they came all of them to the king. 

\v 12 And Saul said, Hear now, O son of Ahitub ! And he answered, Here am I, my lord ! 

\v 13 And Saul said to him, Why have you, together with the son of Jesse, conspired against me, in that you have given him bread and a sword and have inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me as an enemy, as is now the case ? 

\v 14 Then Ahimelech answered the king and said, But who among all your servants is like David, trusted and the king's son-in-law and captain over your retainer& and honored in your household? 

\v 15 Is this the first time I have inquired of God for him ? Far be it from me ! Let not the king impute anything to his servant nor to any one of my clan, for your servant did not know the slightest thing about all this. 

\v 16 But the king said, You shall surely die, Ahimelech, together with all your clan. 

\v 17 And the king said to the runners who stood before him, Turn about and slay the priests of Jehovah, for their hand also was with David, and, although they knew that he was fleeing, they did not disclose it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hands to strike down the priests of Jehovah. 

\v 18 Then the king said to Doeg, Turn and strike down the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned and himself struck down the priests. So he slew on that day eighty-five men who wore
the ephod.

\v 19 And the priestly city Nob he put to the sword, both men and women, children and infants, oxen and asses and sheep.

\v 20 And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled to David .

\v 21 And Abiathar told David that Saul had slain the priests of Jehovah. 

\v 22 And David said to Abiathar, I knew that day, because Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul. I myself am guilty of all the lives of your clan. 

\v 23 Remain with me, fear not; for whoever seeks your life must also seek mine, since you are placed in my charge.


\c 23 

\v 1 Now when David was told, The Philistines are fighting against Keilah and are robbing the threshing floors, 

\v 2 David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go and attack these Philistines ? And Jehovah said to David, Go, attack the Philistines, and save Keilah. 

\v 3 But David's men said to him, Behold we are afraid here in Judah; how much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines. 

\v 4 Then David inquired of Jehovah yet again. And Jehovah answered him, saying, Arise, go down to Keilah, for I will deliver the Philistines into thy hand. 

\v 5 So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines and drove away their cattle and slew a great many of them. Thus David delivered the inhabitants of Keilah. 

\v 6 Now when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, he came down with the ephod in his hand.

\v 7 And when it was told Saul that David had come to Keilah, Saul said, God has sold him into my hand; for he has entrapped himself in entering into a town that has doors and bars.

\v 8 And Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men. 

\v 9 And when David knew that Saul was devising evil against him, he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring here the ephod. 

\v 10 And David said, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, thy servant hath surely heard that Saul is seeking to come to Keilah, to destroy the city because of me. 

\v 11 Will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard ? O Jehovah, God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And Jehovah said, He will come down. 

\v 12 Then David said, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul ? And Jehovah said, They will deliver thee up. 

\v 13 Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed from Keilah, and wandered hither and thither. And when it was reported to Saul that David had escaped from Keilah, he abandoned his expedition.

\v 14 So David dwelt in the wilderness

\v 15 Now David feared because Saul had come out to seek his life; and David was in the Wilderness of Ziph in Horesha. 

\v 16 And Jonathan, Saul's son, arose, and went to David in Horesha and strengthened his hand in God. 

\v 17 And he said to him, Fear not, for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you, and you shall be king over Israel and I shall be next to you; and that also Saul my father well knows. 

\v 18 And they two made a covenant before Jehovah ; and David abode in Horesha, and Jonathan re¬turned home.

\v 19 Then the Ziphites came up to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Is not David hiding himself with us in the strongholds in Horesha, in the hill of Hachilah, which is to the south of the desert ? 

\v 20 Now therefore, O king, according to all your heart's desire come down, and it shall be our part to deliver him into the king's hand. 

\v 21 Then Saul said, Blessed may you be of Jehovah, for you have had compassion on me. 

\v 22 Go, I pray, make yet more sure, and know and see the place where his haunt is and who has seen him there; for I am told that he is very cunning. 

\v 23 See therefore, and gain knowledge of all the lurking-places where he hides, and return to me, with sure information, and I will go with you, and, if he be in the land, I will search him out of all the thousands of Judah.

\v 24 So they arose and went to Ziph before Saul. But David and his men were in the Wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah to the south of the desert. 

\v 25 And when Saul and his men went to seek him, they told David and he went down to the rock which is in the Wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard, he pursued aftert David in the Wilderness of Maon. 

\v 26 And Saul went on the one side of the mountain and David and his men on the other side of the mountain; and David was anxiously trying to escape from Saul, for Saul and his men were about to surround David and his men, to seize them, 

\v 27 when a messenger came to Saul, saying, Come quickly, for the Philistines have made a raid upon the land. 

\v 28 So Saul returned from pursu-
