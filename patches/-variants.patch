; WH marked what they termed "Western Non-Interpolations" in double square brackets. These were passages in the 
; Neutral/Alexandrian manuscripts which were not present in the normally more expansive Western texts which WH
; considered unlikely to be original.
;
; The TCNT marked these with a square bracket.
;
; In line with our intent to follow the WH text, and in line with the choices of 
; the REB amongst others, we will remove these for now, notwithstanding
; the trend of later editions of NA to incorporate them in light of P75.
;
; For the moment, it is better for us to follow a known and 
; respected critical text than to strike out on our own.
;
; Passages which WH were less certain of the inauthenticity of they marked with single
; square brackets. We, like the TCNT and REB, will retain these.
