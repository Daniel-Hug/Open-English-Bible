;   A scan of the literature shows that the meaning of this term (which appears only twice in the NT)
;   is highly contested and the subject of many learned articles and books. It seems likely
;   that it cannot be translated for a modern audience succinctly and we cannot append a multipage essay 
;   on sexual relationships in the Ancient World to this edition. Wait for the OEB Study Bible :) Like 
;   Moffat with 'logos', Ann Nyland just gives up and transliterates, which is not an option for us. We

;   is likely to be contentious and misleading.
