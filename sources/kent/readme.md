These files are a compilation of the various works of Charles Foster Kent with modern additions.

They are standard USFM files with the following simple mechanisms for marking up textual changes:

{ } marks text from Children's Bible
{{ }} marks text from Shorter Bible
{{{ }}} marks text from Student's Old Testament

< > marks deleted text
[ ] marks added text

The script 'stageKent.py' cleans out these markers and drops the now clean and hopefully standard usfm files in the staging directory.
