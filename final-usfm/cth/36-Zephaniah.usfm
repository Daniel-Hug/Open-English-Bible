\ms The Day of Judgment upon Judah
\p ~
\q
\v 2 I will utterly destroy everything from off the face of the earth,
\q3 says the \nd Lord\nd*.
\q
\v 3 I will take away human and animal,
\q2 the birds of the heavens
\q2 and the fish of the sea.
\q I will cause the wicked to stumble,
\q2 and I will cut off humanity from the face of the earth.
\q3 says the \nd Lord\nd*.
\b
\q
\v 4  I will stretch out my hand over Judah
\q2 and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
\q and I will cut off from this place the last remnant of Baal
\q2 and the name of the heathen priests,
\q
\v 5 and those who worship on the housetops
\q2 the host of the heavens,
\q and those worshippers of the \nd Lord\nd*
\q2 who also pay homage to Milcom,
\q
\v 6 and those who turn back
\q2 from following the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q And those who do not seek the \nd Lord\nd*
\q2 nor strive to find him.
\b
\q \p
\v 7 Bow before the Lord \nd God\nd*,
\q2 for near is the day of the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q for the \nd Lord\nd* has prepared a sacrifice,
\q2 he has sanctified his guests.
\b
\q
\v 8 On the day of the \nd Lord's\nd* sacrifice,
\q I will punish the officers and the royal princes,
\q2 and all those who clothe themselves in foreign apparel.
\b
\q On that day,
\q
\v 9 and I will punish all who leap over the threshold,
\q2 who fill the house of their lord with violence and deceit.
\b
\q
\v 10 Listen on that day, says the \nd Lord\nd*.
\q A cry will be heard from the Fish Gate,
\q2 and a wailing from the New Quarter,
\q and a great din from the hills,
\q2 and a wailing from the inhabitants of the Mortar,
\q for all the merchants are destroyed,
\q2 all those laden with money are cut off.
\b
\q
\v 12 I will search Jerusalem with a lamp and I will punish those who are at ease,
\q sit comfortably with their wine, who are saying to themselves,
\q ‘the \nd Lord\nd* brings neither prosperity nor calamity.’
\b
\q
\v 13 Their wealth will become a prey
\q2 and their houses a desolation.
\q Though they build houses,
\q2 they will not inhabit them;
\q though they plant vineyards,
\q2 they will not drink wine from them.
\b
\q
\v 14 Near is the day of the \nd Lord\nd*!
\q2 near and rapidly approaching!
\q Near is the bitter day of the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 and strong men will then cry out.
\b
\q
\v 15 That day is a day of wrath,
\q2 a day of trouble and distress,
\q a day of destruction and desolation,
\q2 a day of darkness and gloom,
\q a day of clouds and thick darkness,
\q2
\v 16 a day of the trumpet and battle-cry,
\q against the fortified cities
\q2 and against the high battlements.
\b
\q
\v 17 And I will bring distress upon the people
\q2 and they will walk as the blind,
\q and their blood will be poured out as dust
\q2 and their flesh as dung.
\p
\v 18 Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to deliver them. For in the day of the wrath of the \nd Lord\nd* and in the fire of his jealousy the whole earth will be devoured. For he will make a speedy end of all the inhabitants of the earth.

\ms The Imminent Judgment upon the Nations
\q
\v 1 Be ashamed within yourselves, be ashamed,
\q2
\v 2 before you become as the drifting chaff,
\q2 before the day of the \nd Lord\nd* comes upon you,
\q2 before the day of the \nd Lord\nd*'s wrath comes upon you.
\q
\v 3 Seek the \nd Lord\nd* all you meek of the earth,
\q2 you who execute his law;
\q Seek righteousness, seek meekness;
\q2 perhaps you may be hidden in the day of the \nd Lord\nd*'s wrath.
\b
\q
\v 4 For Gaza will be forsaken;
\q2 Ashkelon a desolation;
\q Ashdod - by noon will they rout her
\q2 and Ekron be torn up!
\q
\v 5 Woe to the dwellers by the seashore;
\q2 people of the Cherethites!
\q The word of the \nd Lord\nd* is against you,
\q2 Canaan, land of the Philistines!
\p I will destroy you so that you will be without inhabitant,
\v 6 and you will become shepherds cots and folds for flocks. ***
\v 7 In the house of Ashkelon will they lie down at evening by the sea will they feed.
\rem JPS 1917
\q
\v 8 I have heard the taunts of Moab,
\q2 and the revilings of the Ammonites,
\q how they have taunted my people,
\q2 and spoken boastfully concerning their border.
\q
\v 9 Therefore as I live, says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts, the God of Israel:
\q2 Moab will be like Sodom,
\q3 and the Ammonites like Gomorrah,
\q2 a breeding-place of nettles, and saltpits,
\q3 and a desolation, forever;
\q2 the residue of my people will plunder them,
\q3 and the remnant of my nation will inherit them.
\q
\v 10  This will they have for their pride,
\q2 because they have taunted and spoken boastfully
\q2 against the people of the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts.
\q
\v 11  The \nd Lord\nd* will terrify them;
\q2 he will reduce all the gods of the earth; \q then all the peoples of the nations will worship him,
\q2 each in their own land.
\b
\q
\v 12 You, also, Ethiopians,
\q2 slain by his sword are you!
\q
\v 13 And I will stretch out my hand
\q2 against the north and destroy Assyria;
\q And I will make Nineveh a desolation,
\q2 dry as the wilderness,
\q
\v 14 And herds will lie down in her,
\q2 amidst every beast of the earth,
\q Both desert owl and screech owl will lodge in its capitals.
\q The owl will hoot in the window; the raven on the doorstep,
\q2 for the city is destroyed.
\p
\v 15 This is the exultant city which sat secure. She who said to herself, I am and there is none else!  How has she become a desolation! A lair of beasts! Every passerby hisses at her, shakes his hand.
\c 3
\ms Jerusalem's Deep-seated Corruption
\q
\v 1 Woe to the rebellious and unclean city of oppression,
\q
\v 2 She has not obeyed the voice, she has not accepted instruction,
\q In the \nd Lord\nd* she has not trusted, to her God she has not drawn near.
\b
\q
\v 3 Her rulers in her midst are roaring lions.
\q Her judges are evening wolves, who leave nothing over until the morning,
\q
\v 4 Her prophets are braggarts, faithless men.
\q Her priests profane what is holy and do violence to the law.
\b
\q
\v 5 The \nd Lord\nd* is righteous in her midst, he does no wrong,
\q Morning by morning he establishes his decree,
\q Light is not lacking, an oversight is unknown.
\q
\v 6 ‘I have cut off nations, their turrets are destroyed;
\q I have laid waste their broad streets, so that none passes over them.
\q Desolate are their cities without a man, without inhabitant.’
\b
\q
\v 7 I said, ‘Surely she will fear me, she will accept instruction.
\q Nothing will vanish from her eyes that I have impressed upon her;
\q But the more zealously have they made all their deeds corrupt.’
\ms The Future Vindication and Exultation of Jerusalem
\p
\v 8 Wait for me, is the \nd Lord\nd*”s message, until the day when I stand up as a witness, for it is my fixed purpose to gather the nations, to collect the kingdoms, to pour upon them my wrath, even my hot anger; for by the fire of my jealousy will all the earth be consumed.
\p
\v 11 In that day you will not be ashamed of all your transgressions which you only have committed against me; for then I will put out of the midst of you your proudly exulting ones, and you will never again vaunt yourself in my holy mountain.
\v 12 But I will leave in your midst a people humble and poor, and the remnant of Israel will trust in the name of the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 13 They will not do evil, nor speak falsehood, and a deceitful tongue will not be found in their mouth; but they will pasture and lie down, and no one will make them afraid.
\q
\v 14 Cry out with joy, O daughter of Zion, shout aloud, O Israel!
\q Rejoice and exult with all your heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.
\q
\v 15 The \nd Lord\nd* has put away your adversaries, he has turned away your foes;
\q the \nd Lord\nd* is king in your midst, you will see evil no more.
\q
\v 16 In that day it will be said to Jerusalem, Fear not;
\q O Zion, let not your hands droop.
\q
\v 17 The \nd Lord\nd* your God is in your midst, a victorious hero.
\q He will rejoice over you with joy, he will renew his love,
\q He will exult over you with singing,
\v 18 as on a day of festival.
\b
\q I will take away from you your disgrace, and put away from you your reproach.
\q
\v 19 I will destroy at that time all who afflict you.
\q I will deliver the lame, and gather the outcast,
\q I will make them an object of renown and fame in all the earth.
\q
\v 20 I will do good to you, at the time when I gather you.
\q For I will make you an object of fame and renown among all the peoples of the earth;
\q when I bring back your captivity before your eyes.
\b
\q This says the \nd Lord\nd*.
