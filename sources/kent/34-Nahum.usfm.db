[oeb:\p \c 1 \v 1 A message about Nineveh, a vision which came to Nahum from Elkosh.|:]

\ms God’s wrath

\q \v 2 A jealous God is [lord:the \nd Lord\nd*|jehovah:Jehovah]. 
    \q2 Vengeful is [lord:the \nd Lord\nd*|jehovah:Jehovah] and full of wrath.
\q [lord:The \nd Lord\nd*|jehovah:Jehovah] [oeb:does|:doth] not fail to punish; 
    \q2 vengeful is [lord:the \nd Lord\nd*|jehovah:Jehovah] [oeb:against|:toward] his [oeb:enemies|:adversaries]. 
\q \v 3 [oeb:The \nd Lord\nd* is slow to anger, |:]
    [oeb:\q2 great in power.|:]
[oeb:\q The guilty will not escape|:]
    [oeb:\q2 his punishment.|:] 
\b 
\q Storm tempest is his path
    \q2 and cloud is the dust of his feet.
\q \v 4 He [oeb:rebukes|:rebuketh] the sea and [oeb:dries|:drieth] it up
    \q2 and [oeb:makes|:parcheth] all the streams [oeb:run dry|:]. 
\q Bashan and Carmel are languishing 
    \q2 and the bloom of Lebanon is withered.
\b 
\q \v 5 The mountains tremble before him 
    \q2 and the hills dissolve.
\q The earth heaves before him, 
    \q2 the [oeb:|:habitable] world and all [oeb:who live in it|:that dwell therein].
\b 
\q \v 6 Before his indignation who can stand?
    \q2 [oeb:Who can|:Or who] [oeb:withstand|:abide in] the heat of his anger?
\q His wrath pours forth like fire,
    \q2 [oeb:he shatters rocks|:and rocks are shattered by him].
\b 
\q \v 7 [oeb:The \nd Lord\nd* is good|:Good is Jehovah] to those who hope in him, 
    \q2 a place of refuge in the day of trouble.
\q \v 8 In the midst of the overwhelming flood he [oeb:rescues|:rescueth] them.
\q An end he [oeb:makes|:maketh] of those who rise up against him
    \q2 and [oeb:drives|:driveth] his enemies [oeb:into|:with] darkness. 
\b 
[oeb:\q \v 9 Why do you plot against the \nd Lord\nd*?|:]
    [oeb:\q2 He will end you.|:]
    [oeb:\q2 He only takes vengeance once.|:]
\b 
\q \v 10 Thorns, tangled and drenched,
    \q2 they are consumed like dry stubble.
\b
\q \v 11 [oeb:Nineveh! From you has arisen
	\q2 one who plots evil against the \nd Lord\nd*,
	\q2 a counsellor of wickedness.|:]

\ms Good news for Judah

\p \v 12 [oeb:|:For thus saith] [lord:The \nd Lord\nd*|jehovah:Jehovah] [oeb:says|:]:
 
\q [oeb:“Though they are many and strong,
	\q2 they will pass away and be gone.|:The days of my contention are at an end, past and gone.] 
\q Though I have afflicted [oeb:you|:thee], 
	\q2 I will afflict [oeb:you|:thee] no more, 
\q \v 13 and now I will break his yoke [oeb:from your necks|:from off thee] 
    \q2 [oeb:and snap your chains.”|:and will burst they bonds,]
 
\p \v 14 [oeb:|:Thus hath] [lord:The \nd Lord\nd*|jehovah:Jehovah] [oeb:has|:] given [oeb:this|:] command concerning [oeb:you, Nineveh|:thee]:
 
\q “[oeb:Your|:Thy] name [oeb:will|:shall] no longer be remembered.
\q [oeb:I will destroy every idol and image|:from]
	 \q2 in the house of [oeb:your|:thy] God [oeb:|:will I cut off idol and molten image].
\q I will [oeb:destroy even your tomb,|:make thy grave a stench]
	\q2 [oeb:for you are worthless|:].”
\b 
\q [nrsv:\v 15|jps:\c 2 \v 1] [oeb:Look! On|:Behold on] the mountains [oeb:a|:the feet of the] messenger[hebfootnote:\f + Heb. the feet of a messanger\f*|:]
    \q2 [oeb:bringing|:of] good news,
    \q2 [oeb:announcing|:who announces] peace! 
\q “Celebrate the feasts, [oeb:|:O] Judah, 
    \q2 [us:fulfill|cth:fulfil] [oeb:your|:pay the] vows. 
\q [oeb:Never again will evil Nineveh invade your land,|:For the wicked one will never again pass through thee,]
    \q2 [oeb:they are|:He is] destroyed[oeb:|:, cut off]!”

\ms Destruction of the city 
 
\q [nrsv:\c 2 \v 1|jps:\v 2] [oeb:Nineveh!|:] The destroyer has come up against you; 
    \q2 mount guard upon the rampart; 
    \q2 watch the road; brace your[oeb:selves|: loins]; 
    \q2 strengthen your might to the utmost. 
\b 
\q [nrsv:\v 2|:jps:\v 3] [oeb:For the \nd Lord\nd* is restoring the majesty of Jacob|:]
    [oeb:\q2 and of Israel, |:]
[oeb:\q though the devastators have plundered them|:]
    [oeb:\q2 and destroyed their vines.|:]
\b 
\q [nrsv:\v 3|:jps:\v 4] The shields of his warriors are dyed red, 
    \q2 his soldiers are clothed in scarlet, 
\q his chariots gleam like fire 
    \q2 on the day he prepares for battle
    [oeb:\q2 spears are shaken.|:] 
\b 
\q [nrsv:\v 4|:jps:\v 5] Chariots rush across the fields, 
    \q2 plunge about in the open places; 
\q they look like flaming torches, 
    \q2 [oeb:as lightning|:] they dart to and fro [oeb:like lightening|:]. 
\b 
\q [nrsv:\v 5|:jps:\v 6] [oeb:A leader rallies his nobles,|:]
    [oeb:\q2 they hurl themselves forward.|:]
\q They speed on toward the wall; 
    \q2 the storming-shield is set up. 
\b 
\q [nrsv:\v 6|:jps:\v 7] The water-gates are thrown open, 
	\q2 and the palace dissolves in ruins. 
\q [nrsv:\v 7|:jps:\v 8] [oeb:The queen is stripped,|:]
    [oeb:\q2 she is carried off.|:]
[oeb:\q Her maids moan like doves,|:]
    [oeb:\q2 beating upon their breasts.|:]
\b 
\q [nrsv:\v 8|:jps:\v 9] Like a pool of water is Nineveh, 
    \q2 her waters fast ebbing away. 
\q “Stand firm! Stand firm!” [oeb:some|:]one cries. 
    \q2 But [neut:no one|masc:not a man] turns back. 
\b 
\q [nrsv:\v 9|:jps:\v 10] [oeb:“Loot the silver, loot the gold,|:]
    [oeb:\q2 for there is no end to the treasure,|:]
    [oeb:\q2 the wealth and precious things.”|:]
\b 
\q [nrsv:\v 10|:jps:\v 11] [oeb:Nineveh|:She] is empty, desolate, devastated, 
    \q2 with faint heart and knocking knee. 
\q There is weakness in every limb, 
    \q2 and [oeb:|:the] faces [oeb:grow pale|:of all are livid]. 
\b 
\q [nrsv:\v 11|:jps:\v 12] Where now is the den of lions? 
    \q2 Where now the lair of their young? 
\q Where the lion [oeb:used|:was wont] to withdraw, 
    \q2 [oeb:with|:and] his cubs, with none to disturb them? 
\b 
\q [nrsv:\v 12|:jps:\v 13] The lion tore enough for his cubs, 
    \q2 and strangled the prey for his lionesses. 
\q He filled his caves with [oeb:the kill|:booty], 
    \q2 he filled his lairs with [oeb:fresh meat|:spoil]. 
\b 
\q [nrsv:\v 13|:jps:\v 14] “But [oeb:see|:behold], I am against you,”
    \q2 [oeb:the \nd Lord\nd*|:Jehovah] of hosts declares, 
\q “I will burn up your chariots in smoke [oeb:and fire|:]. 
    \q2 The sword [oeb:will|:shall] devour your young [oeb:lions|:]. 
\q [oeb:You will never again prey on the land.|:I will cut off your spoil from the earth.][hebfootnote:\f + Heb. I will cut off your prey from the land\f*|:]
    \q2 No more [oeb:will|:shall] your messengers be heard.”

\ms Ruin
 
\q \c 3 \v 1 Woe to the bloody city! 
    \q2 Full of lies and plunder, 
    \q2 without end is the spoil. 
\q \v 2 Hear the crack of the whip, 
    \q2 hear the rattle of wheels. 
\q Galloping horses, 
    \q2 jolting chariots. 
\q \v 3 Horsemen charging, 
    \q2 swords flashing. 
    \q2 spears glittering, 
\q a multitude of slain, 
    \q2 a heap of carcasses. 
\q No end to the corpses 
    \q2 over which [neut:people|masc:men] stumble! 
\b 
\q \v 4 [oeb:“Because you acted like a whore,
	\q2 bewitching the nations,
	\q2 enticing the peoples,]
\q \v 5 [oeb:|:Behold, ]I am against you, Nineveh”
    \q2 [oeb:the \nd Lord\nd*|:Jehovah] of hosts declares. 
\q “I will [oeb:strip your clothes|:lift up your skirts before you]
    \q2 and show the nations your nakedness,
    \q2 and the kingdoms your shame. 
\b 
\q \v 6 “I will [oeb:fling|:cast] loathsome filth [oeb:at|:upon] you, 
    \q2 and make you an object of contempt,
    \q2 [oeb:a spectacle,|:] 
\q so that everyone who sees you 
    \q2 [oeb:will|:Shall] flee from you and say: 
\q ‘Nineveh is laid waste; 
    \q2 who will mourn for her?’
\b 
\q \v 8 “Are you any better than Thebes, 
    \q2 which stood on the banks of the Nile, 
\q with waters around as a rampart, 
    \q2 whose wall was the sea of waters? 
\q \v 9 Her strength was Ethiopia and Egypt. 
    \q2 The Libyans were her helpers, 
    \q2 and Put with its countless people. 
\q \v 10 Yet she was exiled 
    \q2 and made captive. 
\q On all corners of the streets 
    \q2 her infants were dashed to pieces. 
\q [oeb:Lots were cast for her nobles|:For her honored ones men cast lots], 
    \q2 all her great ones were bound in chains. 
\b 
\q \v 11 “You too, [oeb:|:O] Nineveh, [oeb:will|:shall] be drunk [oeb:with fear|:en, you shall be faint]; 
\ q2 you too [oeb:will|:shall] seek a place of escape from the foe. 
\q \v 12 All your fortresses are fig-trees with the first ripe figs; 
    \q2 if [oeb:|:but] shaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater! 
\q \v 13 Your [oeb:troops|:people] are weak as women [oeb:before|:to face] your foes; 
    \q2 the gates of your land are wide open; 
    \q2 your defenses burned down. 
\b 
\q \v 14 “Draw [oeb:|:thy] water for the siege, 
    \q2 strengthen [oeb:your|:thy] fortresses. 
\q Go to the clay pits and tread the clay; 
    \q2 take up the brick moulds.
\q \v 15 There the fire will consume [oeb:you|:thee], 
    \q2 the sword will cut [oeb:you|:thee] down. 
\b 
\q “[oeb:Multiply like the locust|:It will devour thee, though thou increase thyself like the devouring worm or a swarm of locusts.]
    [oeb:\q2 or a swarm of grasshoppers.|:]
\q1 \v 16 [oeb:Increase the numbers of your merchants|:]
    [oeb:\q2 until they are more than the stars of heaven,|:]
[oeb:\q |:]\v 17 [oeb:until your watchmen are locusts,|:]
    [oeb:\q2 and your scribes like grasshoppers,|:]
    [oeb:\q2 which swarm in the hedges on a cold day;|:]
[oeb:\q but when the sun rises|:]
    [oeb:\q2 they fly away,|:]
    [oeb:\q2 no one knows where.|:]
\b 
\q \v 18 “[oeb:King of Assyria:|:]
    \q2 your [oeb:princes|:shepherds] slumber, 
    \q2 your nobles sleep! 
\q Your people are scattered on the mountains 
    \q2 with [oeb:no one|:none] to gather them! 
\q \v 19 There is no healing for your hurt,
    \q2 your wound is incurable. 
\q All who hear of your fate [oeb:|:loudly] clap their hands[oeb: in joy,|:.]
    [oeb:\q2 for who has escaped your limitless cruelty?”|:]
