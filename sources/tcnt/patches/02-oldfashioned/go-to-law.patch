In Matthew:
    ;  anyone wants to go to law with you, to take your coat, let them have your cloak as well;\wj*   \v 4
    5:39    him also; -> him also.
    5:40    and, when anyone wants to go to law with you, to take your coat  ->  If someone sues you for your shirt

In 1 Corinthians:
    ;  Must a follower go to law with a fellow follower, and that, too, before unbelievers? \v 7 To begin 
    6:6     go to law with ->  sue
    6:6     brother, and that, too, before unbelievers? -> brother? In front of unbelievers?
