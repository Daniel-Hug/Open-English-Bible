\s The Prophet's Lament over the Unfaithfulness of the People to their God

\q \v 2 Hear, ye heavens, and give ear, O earth,
	\q2 For Jehovah Himself is the Speaker. 
\q ‟Sons have I reared and brought up, 
	\q2 But rebellious to Me are they grown.
\q \v 3 An ox knoweth its owner,
	\q2 And an ass its master's crib;
\q But Israel doth not know,
	\q2 My people doth not consider.”
\b
\q \v 4 Ah! sinful nation,
	\q2 Ye people laden with guilt,
\q Ye brood of evil-doers,
	\q2 Ye children all corrupt,
\q That have forsaken Jehovah,
	\q2 And spurned the Holy One of Israel:\fn + 2 \fn*
\b
\q \v 5 Why would ye court more stripes
	\q2 By straying yet further from Him?
\q The head is sick altogether,
	\q2 The heart is all diseased.
\q \v 6 From the sole of the foot to the head
	\q2 There is no soundness therein:
\q Nought but bruises and weals
	\q2 And wounds that are raw and bleeding,
\q All unpressed and unbandaged,
	\q2 All unsoftened with oil.
\b
\q \v 7 Your land is a desolation,
	\q2 Your cities are burned with fire;
\q The fields before your eyes
	\q2 Are being devoured by aliens.\fn + 3 \fn*
\q \v 8 And the daughter\fn + 4 \fn* of Zion is left
	\q2 All alone like a booth in a vineyard,
\q A lodge in a cucumber-field,
	\q2 Or a turret where men keep watch.
\q \v 9 Were it not that Jehovah of Hosts
	\q2 Had left us a remnant,
\q Our fate has been wellnigh like Sodom's,
	\q2 Or like to Gomorrah's.
   
\s The Futility of a Merely Ceremonial Worship 

\q \v 10 Give ear to the world of Jehovah,
	\q2 Ye rules of Sodom;
\q And hear what our God hath to teach you,
	\q2 Ye folk of Gomorrah.
\q \v 11 Jehovah saith, ‟What care I
	\q2 For your multiplied sacrifices?
\q I am sick of burnt offerings of rams
	\q2 And the fat of fed beasts; 
\q Blood of bullocks, of lambs, or goats,
	\q2 Is no pleasure to Me.
\q \v 12 When ye gather to gaze on My face,
	\q2 Who hath asked you for these things?
\q Trample My courts no more,
\q \v 13 Bring offerings no more.
\q Vain is he smoke of sacrifice,
	\q2 To me 'tis abomination.
\q The new moon and sabbath,
	\q2 The call to assembly,
\q The fast\fn + 5 \fn* and the festival
	\q2 I cannot (endure).
\q \v 14 They weigh Me down,
	\q2 I am tired of the burden.
\b
\q \v 15 When therefore ye spread out your hands,
	\q2 I will hide from you Mine eyes;
\q When ye make your many prayers,
	\q2 I will not listen to you.
\q \v 16 Your hands are full of blood:
	\q2 Wash, and make you clean.
\q Banish out of My sight
	\q2 The wicked things that ye do.
\q Cease to do evil, 
\q \v 17 learn to do well.
\q Let justice be ever your care,
	\q2 Punish the man of violence,\fn + 6 \fn*
\q Win for the orphan his rights,
	\q2 And defend the cause of the widow.”

\s The Great Alternatives 

\q \v 18 ‟Come,” saith Jehovah, ‟and now 
	\q2 Let us reason together.
\q Your sins, though like scarlet, may yet 
	\q2 Become white as the snow.
\q And though they be crimson-red,
	\q2 They may yet be as wool.
\q \v 19 If ye be obedient and willing,
	\q2 Ye shall taste the good of the land;
\q \v 20 But if ye refuse and rebel,
	\q2 ‟Tis the sword ye shall taste:
	\q2 For the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken it.”

\s Zion's Present Shame and Future Glory	

\q \v 21 Alas! how the once faithful City
	\q2 Hath turned to be harlot.
\q She that was once full of justice,
	\q2 She wherein righteousness lodged,
	\q2 Is now haunted by murderers.
\q \v 22 Thy silver is now become dross,
	\q2 And thy wine mixed with water.

\q \v 23 Thy rulers are grown to be rebels,\fn + 7 \fn*
	\q2 The comrades of the thieves-
\q Every man of them fond of his bribe,
	\q2 Hunting ever for gifts,
\q Caring nought for the rights of the orphan
	\q2 Or the cause of the widow.
\b
\q \v 24 Therefore thus saith the Lord, Jehovah of Hosts,
	\q2 The Mighty One of Israel:
\q "From Mine enemies who resist Me,
	\q2 I will get Me the comfort of vengeance.
 \v 25 I will turn My hand against thee;
\q I will smelt out thy dross in the furnace,
	\q2 And all thine alloy remove.
\b
\q \v 26 Judges, like those of old,
	\q2 And cousellors as of yore, I will give thee.
\q Thereafter shalt thou called
	\q2 The City of Justice, the Faithful City.
\b
\q \v 27 By justice shall Zion be ransomed,
	\q2 And by righteousness her people.\fn + 8 \fn*
\q \v 28 But together rebels and sinners be crushed,
	\q2 And those that abandon Jehovah shall perish.

\s The Heathen Cult and its Doom

\q \v 29 For the trees\fn + 9 \fn* ye delight in shall bring you to shame,
	\q2 And abashed shall ye be for your gardens beloved.
\q \v 30 Like a tree with withered leaves
	\q2 Shall ye be-like a waterless garden.
\q \v 31 Like tow shall the strong man become,
	\q2 And the thing he hath wrought like a spark;
\q And both shall burn together 
	\q2 In a flame that cannot be quenched.

\s Jerusalem the Centre of Blessing to the World; Arbitration, Disarmament, and International Peace

\p \v 1 The message of Isaiah the son of Amoz: his vision of Judah and Jerusalem.

\q \v 2 In the after-time it shall be
	\q2 That the mountain of Jehovah
\q Shall be set at the head of the mountains,
	\q2 And exalted above the hills.
\q All the peoples shall thither stream,
\q \v 3 Many nations shall go and say,
‟Come, let us go to the mount of Jehovah,
	\q2 To the house of the God of Jacob.
\q That He in His ways may instruct us,
	\q2 And that we in His paths may walk.
\q For instruction proceedeth from Zion,
	\q2 The word of Jehovah from Jerusalem.”
\q \v 4 He will judge the disputes of the peoples,
	\q2 And for manifold nations so justly will arbitrate
\q That their swords they will beat into ploughshares,
	\q2 And to pruning-hooks their spears.
\q Nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
	\q2 And war they shall learn no more.
\b
\q \v 5 O household of Jacob, come,
	\q2 Let us walk in the light of Jehovah.

\ms2 Judgment upon the Wealth and Pride of Judah

\s Jehovah's Judgement-Day

\q \v 6 (Get ye into the caves of the rocks,
	\q2 And hide in the holes of the ground,
\q From Jehovah's dread face, when in glory majestic
	\q2 He riseth-with terror to smile the earth.)\fn + 1 \fn* 
\q For He hath forsaken His people,
	\q2 The household of Jacob.
\b
\q Filled is his land from the east with diviners,\fn + 2 \fn* 
	\q2 With soothsayers like to the Philistines,
	\q2 Sorcerers,\fn + 8 \fn* children of aliens.
\q \v 7 Filled in his land full of silver and gold,
	\q2 And his treasure is endless.
\q Filled in his land full of horses,
	\q2 His chariots are endless.
\q \v 8 Filled is his land full of idols,
	\q2 He worships the work of his hands,
	\q2 The things that his fingers have made.\fn + 4 \fn*
\q \v 11 So the pride of men shall be humbled,
	\q2 Laid low shall man's loftiness be,
	\q2 And that day shall Jehovah alone be exalted. 
\q \v 10 Get ye into the rocks,
	\q2 And hide in the ground,
\q From Jehovah's dread presence 
	\q2 And glory majestic.
\q \v 12 For a day of Jehovah is coming
	\q2 Upon all that is haughty and proud,
	\q2 Upon all that is lofty and high-
\q \v 13 Upon cedars if Lebanon all,
	\q2 And oaks of Bashan all,
\q \v 14 Upon all the great mountains
	\q2 And all the high hills,
\q \v 15 Upon all the proud towers,
	\q2 All fortified walls,
\q \v 16 Upon all ships of Tarshish
	\q2 And all gallant craft.\fn + 5 \fn*
\q \v 17 Then the pride of men shall be humbled,
	\q2 Laid low shall man's loftiness be,
\q And that day shall Jehovah alone be exalted.
\q \v 18 The Idols shall all of them vanish.
\q \v 19 Get ye into the caves of the rocks,
	\q2 And the holes of the ground
\q From Jehovah's dread face, when in glory majestic 
	\q2 He riseth-wuith terror to smile the earth.
\q \v 20 That day shall men cast away
	\q2 To the moles and to the bats
\q Their idols of silver and gold,
	\q2 Which they made for themselves to worship;
\q \v 21 And into the caves of the rocks they shall get them,
	\q2 And into the rents of the cliffs,
\q From Jehovah's dread face, when in glory majestic
	\q2 He riseth-with terror to smile the earth
\q \v 22 Oh cease your trust in man, in whose nostrils is but a bearth: of what account is he?\fn + 6 \fn*

\s A Reign of Anarchy
\c 3

\q \v 1 Behold, the Lord Jehovah of Hosts
	\q2 Taketh staff and stay from Jerusalem and Judah\fn + 1 \fn*-
\q \v 2 Soldiers and Warriors, judges and prophets,
\q \v 3 Deviners and elders, and captains of fifty,
\q Men of distinction, and men of sage counsel,
	\q2 Cunning magicians and skilful enchanters.
\q \v 4 And boys I will give then for princes,
	\q2 And men of caprice shall rule over them.
\q \v 5 The people shall play the tyrant,
	\q2 Each man over his neighbour.
\q The young shall be rude to the aged,
	\q2 The man of low rank to the high.
\q \v 6 One shall take hold of his fellow, and say to him:
	\q2 ‟Your family has a robe;\fn + 2 \fn*
\q Come, and do you be our ruler,
	\q2 And take this ruin in hand.”
\q \v 7 Then will the other protest,
	\q2 ‟Nay, verily: I cannot heal you.
\q In my own house there is no bread,
	\q2 Nor yet is there a robe.
\q Ye shall not thrust upon me
	\q2 The leadership of the people.”
\q \v 8 Jerusalem is stumbling to ruin,
	\q2 And Judah must surely fall;
\q For by word and by deed they defy Jehovah,
	\q2 Provoking those glorious eyes of His.
\q \v 9 Their respecting of persons\fn + 3 \fn* is witness against them;
	\q2 Like Sodom they publish their sin undusguisedly.
	\q2 Woe unto them! They have wrought their own ruin.
\q \v 10 Happy righteous! for well they shall fare,
	\q2 They shall reap the fruit of their doings.
\q \v 11 But woe to the wicked! for ill they shall fare,
	\q2 Their deeds shall be recompensed unto them.
\b
\q \v 12 My people are cruelly governed,
	\q2 Extortioners\fn + 4 \fn* rule over them.
\q O My people, thy leaders mislead,
	\q2 And confuse they way thou shouldst go.
\q \v 13 Jehovah is taking His place for the trial,
	\q2 He standeth to judge His people.\fn + 5 \fn*
\q \v 14 Jehovah doth summon to judgment
	\q2 The elders and princes of His people.
‟Yes, you have devoured the vineyard,
	\q2 The spoil of the poor is in your houses.
\q \v 15 What mean ye by crushing My people
	\q2 And grinding the faces of the poor?”
	\q2 Saith the Lord Jehovah of Hosts.

\s The Doom of the Haughty Women

\q \v 16 Morever Jehovah said:
	\q2 "Because Zion's daughters are haughty,
\q Walking with heads held high,
	\q2 And eyes for ever ogling,
\q With dainty little steps,
	\q2 And anklets ever jingling,
\q \v 17 The Lord shall smite with a scab
	\q2 The head of the daughters of Zion,
	\q2 And their shame shall Jehovah lay bare
\q \v 18 That day the Lord will remove
	\q2 The finery of the anklets,
\q The net-bands and the moons,
\q \v 19 The ear-drops and bracelets and veils,
\q \v 20 The head-dresses, armlets, and sashes,
	\q2 The perfume-boxes and amulets,
\q \v 21 The signet-rings and the nose-rings,
\q \v 22 The state-gowns, the mantles, the shawls, and the satchels,
\q \v 23 The gauzes and linens, the turbans and veils.
\b
\q \v 24 Sweet scents shall give place unto stench,
	\q2 And the girdle be changed for a rope.
\q And well-set hair shall be bald,
	\q2 And for elegant robe shall be sackcloth,
	\q2 For beauty the brand (of a slave).
\q \v 25 Thy\fn + 6 \fn* liegemen shall fall by the sword,
	\q2 And thy mighty men in the battle.
\b
\q \v 26 Her gates shall lament and mourn,
\c 4As she sitteth despoiled on the ground.
\q \v 1 That day shall seven women
	\q2 Take hold of one man and say,
\q "Our own bread will we eat,
	\q2 And our rainment will we wear;
\q But oh, let us bear thy name,
	\q2 And take our reproach away."

\s Zion's Final Glory 

\q \v 2 In that day
\q Shall the wild vegetation\fn + 1 \fn* be glorious and fair,
\q And the fruit of the tilled land majestic and comely
	\q2 For Israel's sons that escape.
\q \v 3 And those that remain in Zion,
	\q2 And those that are left in Jerusalem,
\q Shall be called by the name of holy-
	\q2 All who stand in the book of life.
\q \v 4 When the Lord shall have washed away
	\q2 The filth of the daughters of Zion,
\q And rinsed away from her midst
	\q2 The blood-stains of Jerusalem,
\q By means of the blast of judgment,
	\q2 The blast of extermination,
\q \v 5 Then will Jehovah come,
	\q2 And o'er the whole site of mount Zion
\q And over all the glory
\q \v 6 Shall cover and canopy be--
\q A shade by day from storm and rain.

\ms2 The Vineyard with the Wild Grapes

\s The Song of the Vineyard
\c 5

\q \v 1 A song\fn + 1 \fn* will I sing of my friend,
	\q2 A love-song touching his vineyard.
\q A vineyard belonged to my friend,
	\q2 On a fertile hill-top he had set it.
\q \v 2 He had digged it and cleared it of stones,
	\q2 And choice vines therein he had planted.
\q A tower he had built in the midst,
	\q2 And a winepress therein he had hewn.
\q Then he looked for a yield of good grapes,
	\q2 But the grapes that it yielded were wild.
\b
\q \v 3 Now judge, ye that dwell in Jerusalem,
	\q2 And ye that are freeman of Judah,
	\q2 Judge between me and my vineyard.
\q \v 4 What more could I do for my vineyard
	\q2 That I had neglected to do?
\q And why, when I looked for good grapes,
	\q2 Did it yield only grapes that were wild?
\b 
\q \v 5 So now let me give you to know
	\q2 What I purpose to do my vineyard.
\q I will tear off its hedge, that the beasts may devour it;
	\q2 I will break through its wall, that they trample it down.
\q \v 6 I will make it waste, all unpruned and unweeded,
	\q2 With thorns and with briars overgrown shall it be,
	\q2 And the clouds I will charge to withhold from it rain.
\b
\q \v 7 For the vineyard of Jehovah of Hosts is the household of Israel,
	\q2 The freeman of Judah His cherished plantation.
\q But instead of the justice He looked for was bloodshed,
	\q2 Instead of the right was the cry (of the wronged).

\s The National Sins: Woe!

\q \v 8 Woe unto you who join house unto house
	\q2 And who add one field to another,
\q Till no one has room but you,
	\q2 And ye settle the land by yourselves.
\q \v 9 Jehovah of Hosts in mine ear hath whispered,
\q Surely many a great fine house
	\q2 Shall be desolate and empty,
\q \v 10 For ten acres of vineyard shall yield but eight gallons,\fn + 3 \fn*
\q And the harvest shall be but one tenth\fn + 4 \fn* of the seed.
\b
\q \v 11 Woe unto them that rise early
	\q2 To give themselves to drink,
\q And to those that sit late in the evening,
	\q2 Inflaming themselves with wine;
\q \v 12 Whose banquets of wine are enlivened
	\q2 With lute, harp, timbrel, and flute;
\q But all blind to the work of Jehovah,
	\q2 They see not the things He is doing.
\q \v 13 Therefore all unaware\fn + 5 \fn* shall My people
	\q2 Be swept into exile afar--
\q Their nobleman dying of hunger,
	\q2 Their populace parched with thirst.
\b
\q \v 14 Therefore\fn + 6 \fn* Sheol with ravenous throat
	\q2 Opens wide her jaws without measure.
\q And down shall her splendour go,
	\q2 And her noisy tumutuous rabble,
	\q2 With all that in her was exultant.\fn + 7 \fn*
\q \v 17 And there shall lambs graze as at pasture,
	\q2 And fatlings shall feed in her ruins.
\q \v 16 Thus through judgment Jehovah of Hosts is exalted,
	\q2 The holy God shows Himself holy by righteousness.
\b
\q \v 18 Woe unto those that draw penalty on
	\q2 By their sin, as by stout wagon-ropes drawn by oxen;\fn + 8 \fn*  
\q \v 19 That say, ‟Let Him haste, let Him act with speed,
	\q2 In order that we may see it;
\q Let the purpose of Israel's Holy One come
	\q2 So near that we recognize it.”
\b
\q \v 20 Woe unto those that call evil good,
	\q2 And good evil;
\q To those that turn light into darkness,
	\q2 And darkness to light;
\q To those that turn sweet into bitter,
	\q2 And bitter to sweet.
\b
\q \v 21 Woe unto those that esteem themselves wise,
	\q2 And that fancy themselves to be prudent.
\b
\q \v 22 Woe unto those that are valiant in wine-drinking,
	\q2 Warriors brave at the mingling of drink;
\q \v 23 Whom a bribe will induce to acquit the guilty,
	\q2 And innocent men to deprive of their rights.
\b
\q \v 24 As fire licks up the stubble,
	\q2 And hay is shrivelled in flame,
\q So their root shall turn to rottenness,
	\q2 And their blossom go up in dust;
\q Because they rejected Jehovah's instruction,
	\q2 And the message of Israel's Holy One scorned.

\s A Foreign Army is Coming

\q \v 25 So\fn + 9 \fn* against His people His anger was kindled,
	\q2 Against them He stretched forth His hand and He smote them;
\q The mountains shook, and the dead
	\q2 Lay like refuse about the streets.
\s For all this His anger is not turned back,
	\q2 But His hand is stretched out still.
\q \v 26 To a far-distant nation He raises His signal,
	\q2 And whistles\fn + 10 \fn* for them from the end of the earth.
\q See! hastily, swiftly they come--
\q \v 27 None weary, none stumbling among them,
	\q2 Unsleeping and slumbering never:
\q The band of their loins never loosed,
	\q2 The thong of their shoes never torn.
\q \v 28 Their arrows are sharp,
	\q2 And their bows are all bent:
\q The hoofs of their horses are counted as flint,
	\q2 And their wheels as the whirlwind.
\q \v 29 Their roar is like that of a lioness,
	\q2 And like the young lions they roar,
\q Growling and seizing the prey,
	\q2 And bearing it far beyond rescue.
\q \v 30 That day they shall roar over him,\fn + 11 \fn*
	\q2 With a roar like the roar of the sea:
\q When he looks on the earth, behold! darkness,
	\q2 The light has grown dark in the clouds.

\ms2 The Prophet's Call

\c 6
\p \v 1 In the year that King Uzziah died,\fn + 1 \fn*I had a vision of the Lord seated on a high and lofty throne, and  \v 2 the skirts if His robe filled the Temple. Before Him were standing seraphs, each with six wings - two for covering the face, two the loins, and two \v 3 to fly with; and thus they kept calling to one another:

\q ‟Holy, holy, holy, is Jehovah of Hosts;
	\q2 The whole earth is filled with His glory.”

\p \v 4 At the sound of their calling the foundations of threshold shook, and the House began to fill \v 5 with smoke. Then I said

\q ‟Woe is me, for I am undone;
\q For a man of unclean lips am I,
	\q2 And I dwell in a nation of unclean lips;
\q And yet mine eyes have seen
	\q2 The King, Jehovah of Hosts.”

\p \v 6 Then one of the seraphs flew to me with a live coal in his hand, which with tongs he had taken \v 7 from off the altar. With this he touched my mouth, and said,

\q ‟See, this hath touched thy lips:
	\q2 Thy guilt is past and thy sin forgiven.”
\b
\q \v 8 Then I heard the voice of the Lord,
	\q2 Saying,‟Whom shall I send? who will go for us?”
	\q2 And I said, ‟Here am I, send me.”
\q \v 9 Then He said, ‟Go and say to this people
\q 'Hear ever, but understand never;
	\q2 See ever, but comprehend never.'
\q \v 10 Make thou the heart of this people callous,
	\q2 Dull thou their ears and besmear their eyes,
\q Lest they see with their eyes, lest they hear with their ears,
	\q2 And their heart understand, and their health come again.”
\q \v 11 Then I said, ‟Till cities lie wasted,
	\q2 With not an inhabitant left;
\q Till houses hold men no more,
	\q2 And the land is left a desolation;
\q \v 12 Till Jehovah removes men afar
	\q2 And wide tracts of the land lie forsaken.
\q \v 13 And should there be in it a tenth still left,
	\q2 That too, in its turn, must be given to the fire,
	\q2 Like the stump of an oak or a terebinth felled.”\fn + 2 \fn* 

\ms2 The Crisis Created by the Menace to Judah in 735 B.C.

\s The Prophet's World to the Terrified King
\c 7

\p \v 1 In the days Ahaz, the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, Rezin King of Aram,\fn + 1 \fn* and Pekah, the son of Remaliah, King of Israel, marched against  Jerusalem to attack it: but they were unable to develop an actual assault upon it. \v 2 When news reached the Court that the Aramean army was on Ephraimite\fn + 2 \fn* soil, the heart of Ahaz and his people shook like forest-trees before the \v 3 wind. Then Jehovah said to Isaiah, ‟Go out-- thou and thy son Shear-yashub--to meet Ahaz at the end of the conduit of the upper pool on the \v 4 Fuller's Field Road, and say to him: Be careful to keep calm: be not faint-hearted or afraid of this pair of fire-brands that are nothing but smoking stumps. Be not afraid of the fierce anger of Rezin \v 5 and Aram and the son of Remaliah. Aram and  Ephraim\fn + 3 \fn* with the son of Remaliah have indeed \v 6 plotted thy ruin: their purpose is to invade Judah and, after reducing her straits, to break into (Jerusalem); then, having overpowered her, they purpose to set the son of Tabeel\fn + 4 \fn*on the throne. \v 7 But thus saith the Lord Jehovah:

\q'This thing shall not succeed,
	\q2 It shall not come to pass.
\q \v 8 For the head of Aram is Damascus,
	\q2 And the head of Damascus is Rezin;\fn + 5 \fn* 
\q \v 9 The head of Ephraim is Samaria,
	\q2 And the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah.
\q Your faith must firmly hold,
	\q2 If ye would yourselves be held.'”\fn + 6 \fn*

\s The Great refusal and the Sign

\p \v 10 One more I\fn + 7 \fn* addressed Ahaz thus, ‟Ask Jehovah \v 11 your God for a sign--ask it (if you like) either from the depths of the under-world or from the heights \v 12 above.”

\q ‟No,” replied Ahaz, ‟I will not ask for one: that would be equivalent to submitting \v 13 Jehovah to a test.”\fn + 8 \fn* Then I said, ‟Hear then, ye household of David. Is not enough for you to weary mortal men that ye must weary my God as well? \v 14 You shall have a sign therefore from the Lord Himself.

\q Behold!
\q A maid\fn + 9 \fn* is with child, she shall bring forth a son,
	\q2 And shall call his name Immanuel.\fn + 10 \fn*
\q \v 15 Honey and curd shall he eat,
	\q2 When he knows how to choose what is good,
	\q2 And to shun what is evil.
\q \v 16 For ere the child shall know
	\q2 How to choose what is good
	\q2 And to shun what is evil,
\q That land shall be deserted
	\q2 Whose two kings thou so dreadest.

\s Judah shall also be Ravaged 

\q \v 17 Jehovah shall bring upon thee thy people
	\q2 And on thy father's house
\q Such days as have never yet been,
	\q2 Since Ephraim departed\fn + 11 \fn*from Judah\fn + 12 \fn*
\q \v 18 That day it shall come to pass
\q That Jehovah shall whistle\fn + 13 \fn* for the flies and the
	\q2 bees.\fn + 14 \fn*
\q \v 19 They shall come every one, and then down they 
	\q2 shall settle
\q In the steep-walled ravines and in clefts of the rocks,
	\q2 And on all thorn-hedges and places of pasture.
\b
\q \v 20 That day shall the Lord shave bare
	\q2 With a razor that is hired
	\q2 In the land beyond the River\fn + 15 \fn*
\q Both the head and hidden hair;
	\q2 And the beard too shall be snipped.
\q \v 21 And in that day shall a man
	\q2 Keep but two sheep and a cow;
\q \v 22 Yet the plenteous yield of milk
	\q2 Shall supply him fare of curd.
\q For the fare of every man
	\q2 That is left upon the land
	\q2 Shall be nought but curd and honey.
\q \v 23 And in that day every spot
	\q2 Where were once a thousand vines,
\q Worth a thousand silver pieces,\fn + 16 \fn*
	\q2 Shall with thorns and briers be covered.
\q \v 24 With bow and with arrow shall men come thither,
	\q2 For all the land shall be thorns and briers.
\q \v 25 Fear of thorns and briers shall hold men afar
	\q2 From the hills that used to be hoed with the hoe.
	\q2 There cattle shall wander and sheep shall tread.

\s The Fall of Damascus and Samaria

\c 8

\p \v 1 Jehovah said to me, ‟Take a large tablet, and write upon it in the common script 'Speed-spoil \v 2 Hurry-prey;'\fn + 1 \fn* and take (two) reliable witnesses, \v 3 Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.” Then after the prophetess,\fn + 2 \fn* through my approach to her, had conceived and borne a son, Jehovah said to me, ‟Call his name Speed-spoil Hurry-prey.

\q \v 4 For ere the child shall know
	\q2 How to cry 'My farther! My mother!'
\q The wealth of Damascus, the spoil of Samaria,
	\q2 Shall be carried away to the king of Assyria.”

\s The Invasion of Judah

\p \v 5 Once more I had a message from Jehovah--it was this:

\q \v 6 ‟Because this people hath spurned
	\q2 The gentle stream of Shiloah,
\q And melt with fear\fn + 3 \fn* of Rezin
	\q2 And the son of Remaliah,
\q \v 7 Therefore, behold, the Lord
	\q2 Will speedily bring upon them
\q The waters of the River,\fn + 4 \fn*
	\q2 The great and mighty River\fn + 5 \fn*
\q It shall rise above all its channels,
	\q2 And overflow all its banks.
\q \v 8 On it shall sweep over Judah,
	\q2 An overflowing flood
	\q2 That shall reach as high as the neck.”
\q But (Jehovah's)\fn + 6 \fn* outstretched wings
	\q2 Shall cover the breadth of the land;
	\q2 For with us is God.

\s The Futility of Opposition to Judah

\q \v 9 Ye may storm as ye will, ye nations,
	\q2 Ye shall be shattered.
\q All ye far-distant lands
	\q2 Of the earth, give ear.
\q Ye may gird yourselves for the fray,
	\q2 But ye all shall be shattered.
\q \v 10 Ye may forge your plans as ye will,
	\q2 They shall all be confounded.
\q Be your resolves what they will,
	\q2 They shall not be accomplished;
	\q2 For with us is God.

\s None is to be Feared but Jehovah

\p \v 11 These were Jehovah's words to me, as He grasped me with His hand and warned me not to walk in the ways of the people:

\q \v 12 ‟Call ye not all a conspiracy\fn + 7 \fn*
	\q2 That this people calleth conspiracy.
	\q2 Share not their fears and their dreads.
\q \v 13 But Jehovah of Hosts--it is He
	\q2 Ye should count as the great Conspirator.\fn + 8 \fn*
	\q2 Let Him be your fear and your dread.
\q \v 14 A stone\fn + 9 \fn* and a rock He shall prove, whereon
	\q2 Both houses of Israel shall strike and stumble--
	\q2 A trap and a snare to the folk of Jerusalem.
\q \v 15 Many among them shall stumble and fall,
	\q2 Shall be broken and snared and taken.

\s Isaiah's Patient Hope

\p \v 16 I will seal my teaching and fasten my message \v 17 in (the heart of) my disciples.\fn + 10 \fn* I will patiently wait for Jehovah who hideth His face from the \v 18 household of Israel; I will set my hope in Him. I myself and the children Jehovah has given me are in Israel as signs and symbols\fn + 11 \fn* from Jehovah of Hosts whose home is on Mount Zion.

\s The Awful Plight of Unbelieving Judah

\p \v 19 When they tell you have recourse to ghosts and familiar spirits that chirp and mutter, ask them if a nation should not rather have recourse to its God. Why should they consult the dead on behalf \v 20 of the living? Assuredly they shall (one day) clamour for the teaching and the message, when there is no  day-break for them any more.\fn + 12 \fn*

\q \v 21 They shall range through the land sore pressed and hungry,
	\q2 And hunger shall curse their king and their God.
\q \v 22 They shall lift up their eyes to the heavens above,
	\q2 They shall look to the earth beneath;
\q But nought shall they see save distress and anguish,
	\q2 And thick impenetrable gloom.

\s The Great Deliverance and the Glorious King
\c 9

\p \v 1 In\fn + 1 \fn* the former time He brought the territory of Zebulon and Naphtali\fn + 2 \fn* into contempt, but in the latter time hath He covered with glory the ground held by the nations beyond the Jordan\fn + 3 \fn* on the way to the sea.\fn + 4 \fn*

\q \v 2 The people that walked in darkness
	\q2 Have seen a glorious light:
\q Those that dwelt in the land of gloom--
	\q2 Om them the light hath shone.
\b
\q \v 3 Thou hast multiplied their gladness\fn + 5 \fn*
	\q2 And given them\fn + 5 \fn* great joy:
\q The joy they made in Thy presence
	\q2 Was like the joy of harvest;
\q Their gladness was like the gladness
	\q2 Of men who divide the spoil.
\b
\q \v 4 For the yoke that pressed so heavy,
	\q2 And the bar upon their shoulders,
\q And the rod of their taskmasters,
	\q2 Thou hast broken as on Midian's day.\fn + 6 \fn*
\b
\q \v 5 Every boot of thundering warrior,
	\q2 Every war-cloak drenched with blood,
\q Is destined for the burning,
	\q2 Shall be fuel for the fire.
\b
\q \v 6 For to us a child is born,
	\q2 Unto us a son is given,
\q On whose shoulder is dominion;
	\q2 And this is the name he bears--
\b
\q ‟Counsellor most wonderful,
	\q2 God with the warrior might,
\q Father everlasting,
	\q2 Prince of the reign of peace.”
\b
\q \v 7 Great is the dominion
	\q2 And endless is the peace,
\q Upon the throne of David,
	\q2 And over all his realm:
\b
\q To establish and uphold it
	\q2 In the righteousness and justice
\q From henceforth and for ever.
	\q2 The zeak of Jehovah of Hosts
	\q2 Shall bring this thing to pass.

\ms2 The Doom of Israel

\q \v 8 The Lord sent a word into Jacob,
	\q2 On Israel it shall alight
\q \v 9 With a power all the people shall feel
	\q2 In Ephraim and in Samaria.
\q They have stiffened their neck in pride,\fn + 7 \fn*
	\q2 In their stoutness of heart they have said:
\q \v 10 ‟The bricks are fallen down,
	\q2 But now we will build with hewn stone.
\q The sycomores are cut down,
	\q2 But with cedars we will replace them.”
\q \v 11 So against them Jehovah hath stirred up their foes,\fn + 8 \fn*
	\q2 He hath spurred their enemies on;
\q \v 12 Syrians east, and Philistines west,
	\q2 Have with open mouth devoured Israel.
 \q Yet for all this His anger is not turned back,
	\q2 But His hand is stretched out still. 
\b
\q \v 13 But the people turned not unto Him that smote them,
	\q2 Nor did they resort to Jehovah of Hosts.
\q \v 14 So He cut off from Israel head and tail,
	\q2 Palm-branch and rush in a single day.
\q \v 15 The elders and men of repute are the head,
	\q2 And the prophets whose teaching is false are the tail.\fn + 9 \fn*
\q \v 16 Those who should lead this people mislead them,
	\q2 And those whom they ought to have led are destroyed.\fn + 10 \fn*
\q \v 17 The Lord will therefore not spare\v 11  their youths,
	\q2 On their orphans and widows He taketh no pity
\q For each and all are profane and wicked,
	\q2 And every mouth speaketh impious folly.
\s Yet for all this His anger is not turned back,
	\q2 But His hand is stretched out still.
\b
\q \v 18 For wickedness blazed like a fire
	\q2 That devoureth first thorns and briers,
\q Then sets forest thickets aflame,
	\q2 Till they roll in columns of smoke.
\q \v 19a By the breath of Jehovah the land was scorched,
\q \v 19b The people became like cannibals.\fn + 12 \fn*
\q \v 20a They carved on the right, yet were hungry,
\q \v 20b Devoured on the left, unappeased;
\q \v 19c No man did pity his fellow,
\q \v 20c But each ate the flesh of his neighbour\fn + 13 \fn*--
\q \v 21 Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh;
	\q2 And both against Judah together.
\s Yet for all this His anger is not turned back,
	\q2 But His hand is stretched out still.
\b
\c 10
\q \v 1 Woe unto those that give mischievous verdicts,
	\q2 Elaborate scrolls that bring sorrow,
\q \v 2 By robbing the weak of their rights
	\q2 And by plundering the poor of their due,
\q So that widows become their spoil,
	\q2 And orpahns fall a prey.
\q \v 3 But what will ye do in the Day of Assize
	\q2 Which will come like a crash from afar?
\q To whom will ye flee for help,
	\q2 And where will ye leave your abundance,
\q \v 4 That ye crouch not under the prisoners\fn + 1 \fn*
	\q2 Or fall among the slain?
\q <i>Yet for all this His anger is not turned back,
	\q2 But his hand is stretched out still.\fn + 2 \fn*</i>

\ms2 The Doom of Assyria
\s The Two Plans--Assyria's and Jehovah's 

\q \v 5 Ho! Assyria! Rod of mine anger,\fn + 3 \fn*
	\q2 And staff of Mine indignation!
\q \v 6 Against an impious people\fn + 4 \fn* I send Him,
	\q2 A nation that sore hath provoked Me to wrath;
\q And I solemnly charge him to spoil and to plunder
	\q2 And trample them down like the mire of the streets.
\q \v 7 Not such, however, is his fancy,\fn + 5 \fn* 
	\q2 Nor such the thought of his heart;
\q But his thought is the utter destruction
	\q2 Of nations not a few.
\b
\q \v 8 ‟Are my captains,” he says, ‟not all kings?
\q \v 9 Is not Calno's fate like Carchemish,
\q And Hamath's fate like Arpad's,
	\q2 And Samaria's like Damascus?\fn + 6 \fn*
\q \v 10 My hand hath seized those kingdoms
	\q2 With images more than Jersusalem's;
\q \v 11 And shall I not do to Jerusalem
	\q2 And to her images also,
\q As I have done to Samaria
	\q2 And to her idols also?
\q \v 12 When\fn + 7 \fn* the Lord hath accomplished all His work on
\q Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, He will punish the fruit
\q of the stout heart of the king of Assyria and the glory of 
\q his lofty looks. For the hath said,
\q \v 13 By the strength of my hand have I done it,
	\q2 And by my cunning duscernment,
\q Removing the bounds of the nations,
	\q2 And plundering their treasures.
\q I have brought down cities to ashes,
	\q2 To dust those that dwell therein.\fn + 8 \fn*
\q \v 14 I thrust my hand in the wealth
	\q2 of the nations, as into a nest;
\q And all the earth have I gathered
	\q2 As one gathers eggs that are left:
\q There was not a wing that fluttered,
	\q2 None opened the mouth or chirped.”
\b
\q \v 15 Shall an axe boast over the man that wields it,
	\q2 Or saw treat with insolence him that doth handle it?
\q As if ever a rod could swing him that doth lift it,
	\q2 Or staff of wood could brandish a man!

\s The Fate of Assyria and Judah

\q \v 16 So into his fat shall the Lord
	\q2 Jehovah of Hosts send leanness,
\q And under his splendour a burning
	\q2 Shall burn like the burning of fire.
\q \v 17 That flaming fire is the Holy One,
	\q2 He that is Israel's Light;
\q It shall blaze and devour his thorns
	\q2 And his briers in a single day.
\q \v 18 His glorious forest and gardens
	\q2 Shall vanish, body and soul,
	\q2 Like a sick man pinning awa;\fn + 9 \fn*
\q \v 19 And his forest trees that are left
	\q2 Shall be few, that a child may record them.
\b
\q \v 20 That day it shall come to pass,
	\q2 That no more shall the remnant of Jacob
\q Or those that escape of the household of Israel
	\q2 Lean upon him\fn + 10 \fn* that smote them:
\q They shall loyally lean on Jehovah,
	\q2 The Holy One of Israel.
\q \v 21 A remnant shall return,
	\q2 Even a remnant of Jacob,
	\q2 Unto the mighty God.
\q \v 22 For though thy people, O Israel,
	\q2 Be even as the sand of the sea,
	\q2 But the remnant of them shall return.
\q Destruction is decreed,
	\q2 Breaking in like a flood of judgment.
\q For destruction, fixed and final,
	\q2 Jehovah of Hosts will accomplish
	\q2 In the midst of all the earth.

\s The Consolation of Zion: Assyria will assurely fall

\q \v 24 Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah,
	\q2 ‟Ye My people who dwell in Zion,
\q Be not afraid of Assyria,
	\q2 Who smiteth thee with the sword,
\q And lifted this staff against thee
	\q2 As Egypt did not old.
\q \v 25 For yet a little while,
	\q2 My fury will be spent,
	\q2 And Mine Anger shall have an end.
\q \v 26 Over him shall Jehovah brandish
	\q2 A scourge like that which smote
	\q2 Upon Midian at Raven's Rock.\fn + 11 \fn*
\q And that rod of His over the sea--
	\q2 He will lift it up once more
	\q2 As He did against Egypt of old.
\q \v 27 His burden shall pass from thy shoulder,
	\q2 His yoke press thy neck no more.
\q From Rimmon\fn + 12 \fn* he\fn + 13 \fn* hath gone up
\q \v 28 He hath come as far as Ai,
\q Through Migron he hath passed,
	\q2 He hath stored his baggage at Michmash,
\q \v 29 He hath gone accross the pass,
	\q2 He hath bivouacked in Geba.
\q Raman is all a-tremble,
	\q2 Gibeah of Saul is in flight.
\q \v 30 Ye people of Gallim, shriek;\fn + 14 \fn*
	\q2 Listen, O Laishah;
\q Answer her, Anathoth;
\q \v 31 Madmenah taketh to flight.
\q The people of Gebin seek refuge.
\q \v 32 This day he will halth at Nob.
\q He shaketh his fist against
	\q2 The Mount of the daughter of Zion,
	\q2 The hill of Jerusalem.
\b
\q \v 33 But see! the Lord Jehovah of Hosts
	\q2 Is lopping the branches with fearful crash;
	\q2 And those that were lofty are now laid low.
\q \v 34 He strikes with His axe the wild thickets away,
	\q2 And Lebanon's glorious cedar\fn + 15 \fn* are fallen.

\q \v 1 There shall come forth a shoot from the stock of

\q \v 2 Jehovah's own spirit shall rest upon him--
	\q2 The spirit of wisdom and insight,
\q The spirit of counsel and might,
	\q2 Of the knowledge and fear of Jehovah.
\q \v 3 He\fn + 1 \fn* will not judge after the sight of his eyes,

\q With the rod of his mouth he will smite the tyrant,\fn + 2 \fn*
	\q2 And slay the unjust with the breath of his lips.
\q \v 5 His loins shall be girt with the girdle of justice,

\b

\p \v 1 Oracle on Babylon\fn + 1 \fn*: a vision of Isaiah the son of 
	\q2 Amoz.

\q \v 2 On a bare height raise the signal,
	\q2 And cry aloud to them.
\q Wave ye the hand that they enter
	\q2 The gates of those lordly men.\fn + 2 \fn*
\q \v 3 I\fn + 3 \fn* have myself commisioned
	\q2 My consecrated servants
	\q2 To execute Mine anger.
\q Yea, I have summoned My warriors,

\q \v 4 Hark! on the hills a tumult
	\q2 As of a mighty multitude.
\q Hark! it's the roar of kingdoms,
	\q2 Of nations gathering together.
\q Jehovah of Hosts is mustering
	\q2 His army for the battle.
\b
\q \v 5 They come from a distant land,
	\q2 From the uttermost end of heaven--
\q Jehovah, with His weapons of wrath,
	\q2 To ruin all the earth.
\q \v 6 Wail! for the day of Jehovah is nigh,
	\q2 Like destruction from God Almighty it cometh.
\q \v 7 All hands shall therefore hang helpless,
	\q2 Each mortal heart will melt,
\q \v 8 And men will be confounded.
\q Taken with throes and pangs,
	\q2 They shall writhe like a woman in travail.
\q They shall look on each other astonished,
	\q2 With faces all aflame.
\b
\q \v 9 Behold! Jehovah cometh,
	\q2 With wrath and hot anger cruel,
\q To make earth a desolation
	\q2 And destroy the sinners upon it.
\q \v 10 The heavens and their constellations
	\q2 Shall not flash any light;
\q The sun shall be dark when it riseth,
	\q2 No light of moon shall shine.
\q \v 11 I will punish the world for its evil,

\q I will still the conceit of the arrogant,

\q \v 12 And men shall be rarer than gold,\fn + 4 \fn*

\q \v 14 And then, like a hunted gazelle,

\q \v 22 Hyenas shall howl in her castles,
	\q2 And wolves in her halls of delight.
\q Her time is wellnigh come,
	\q2 Her day lasteth not much longer.


\s Song of Trimph over the Fall of Babylon's King 

\c 14

\p \v 1 For Jehovah\fn + 1 \fn* will take pity on Jacob, He will elect Israel once more and settle them on their own land: resident aliens will join them and attach themselves to the household \v 2 of Jacob. (Alien) people will take them and bring  them to their place; and the household of Israel shall employ them in Jehovah's land as men-servants and maid-servants, thus reducing their erstwhile captors to captivity, and lording it over those who had been their taskmasters. \v 3 Then, in the day that Jehovah giveth you rest from your toil and turmoil and from the hard service that was \v 4 laid upon you, you shall take up this taunt-song over the King of Babylon, and say:

\q How still the oppressor is grown!
	\q2 How still is the insolent raging!
\q \v 5 Jehovah hath broken the staff
	\q2 Of the godless, the scepter of tyrants,
\q \v 6 That smote the peoples in fury
	\q2 With unremitting stroke,
\q That trod down the nations in anger
	\q2 With unrelenting tread.
\q \v 7 All earth is at rest, is quiet,
	\q2 They break into happy cries.
\q \v 8 Yea, the fir-trees rejoice at they fate,
	\q2 And the cedars of Lebanon, saying,
‟Since thou hast been laid low,
	\q2 No woodsman is come to destroy us.”
\b
\q \v 9 sheol beneath is a-quiver,
	\q2 Awaiting thine arrival;
\q She rouseth the shades to greet the--
	\q2 All that were chieftains on earth.
\q All the kings of the nations
	\q2 She biddeth arise from their thrones.
\q \v 10 All of them lift up their voices,
	\q2 And thus they say unto thee:
‟So thou, too, art feeble as we;
	\q2 Thou art become like us.”
\q \v 11 Thy pomp hath been brought down to Sheol--
	\q2 The strumming of thy lutes:
\q Beneath thee the maggots are spread,
	\q2 Thy coverlet is worms.
\b
\q \v 12 How art thou fallen from heaven,
	\q2 Thou radiant son of the morning!
\q How art thou struck to the ground,
	\q2 Lying stiff, a corpse upon corpses.\fn + 2 \fn*
\q \v 13 And thou, thou didst say in thine heart,
	\q2 ‟Into heaven I will ascend;
\q I will set my throne on high
	\q2 Above the stars of God,
\q And sit on the sacred Mountain\fn + 3 \fn*
	\q2 In the uttermost parts of the north.
\q \v 14 I will climb above the cloud-peaks,
	\q2 And rival the Most High.”
\q \v 15 But down thou art brought to Sheol,
	\q2 To the very depths of the pit.
\b
\q \v 16 They that see thee shall gaze and gaze,
	\q2 They shall ask with eyes intent,
\q ‟Is this the man that startled the earth
	\q2 And sent tremors through her kingdoms;
\q \v 17 That made the world like a desert,
	\q2 And overthrew her cities;
\q That left not his prisoners free,
	\q2 To return each man to his home?”
\q \v 18 Now in their honoured tombs
	\q2 All the kings of the nations are lying;
\q \v 19 But thou art cast forth, tombless,
	\q2 Like a hateful untimely birth,
\q Clothed upon\fn + 4 \fn* with the slain,
	\q2 Whose bodies the sword hath peirced,
\q That go down to the floor of the pit,
	\q2 Like a carcase trodden under foot.
\q \v 20 Thou shalt not be joined unto them
	\q2 In the place where they lie buried;
\q Because thou hast ruined thy land,
	\q2 Thy people thou hast slaughtered.
\q May it never be named again--
	\q2 The race of this evil-doer.
\q \v 21 Get ready the knife for his sons,
	\q2 To atone for the guilt of their father;
\q Lest they rise and posses the earth,
	\q2 And fill the face of the world.\fn + 5 \fn*

\p \v 22 I will rise up against them, saith Jehovah of Hosts, cut off from Babylon record and remnant, kith and kin,  saith Jehovah. And I will make it a possession of the bittern, and pools of water; and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith Jehovah of Hosts.

\ms2 Jehovah's Invincible World-Plan 

\q \v 24 Jehovah of Hosts hath sworn this oath:
\q My plan shall most surely be done,
	\q2 And the thing that I purposed shall stand.
\q \v 25 On the land that is Mine I will shatter Assyria,
	\q2 And trample him down on My mountains.
\q His yoke shall oppress them no more,
	\q2 And his burden shall pass from their shoulders\fn + 6 \fn*
\q \v 26 This is the purpose formed 
	\q2 To humble all the earth;
\q And this is the Hand outstretched
	\q2 Against the nations all.
\q \v 27 For who can bring to nought
	\q2 What Jehovah of Hosts hath purposed?
\q And when His is the Hand that is outstretched,
	\q2 Who can turn it back?

\ms2 Warning to Philistia

\q \v 28 In the year that King Ahaz died, came this oracle:
\q \v 29 Rejoice not, ye Philistines all,
	\q2 That the rod that hath scourged you is broken;
\q For an asp from the root of the root of the serpent shall issue,
	\q2 Its fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent.\fn + 7 \fn*
\b
\q \v 30 For the poor\fn + 8 \fn* shall feed on My meadows,\fn + 9 \fn*
	\q2 The needy shall lie down secure;
\q But thy seed I will kill with famine,
	\q2 Thy remnant I will slay.
\b
\q \v 31 Wail, ye gates;\fn + 10 \fn* and shriek, ye cities:
	\q2 Melt with fear, ye Philistines all.
\q For out of the north cometh smoke (of war),
	\q2 In the ranks of the foe shall no straggler be found.
\q \v 32 What answer shall (Judah) make
	\q2 To the envoys of that nation?\fn + 11 \fn*
\q That ‟Jehovah Himself is the founder of Zion,
	\q2 And there do His suffering people find refuge.”\fn + 112 \fn*


\ms2 Lament over Moab
\c 15
\p \v 1 Oracle on Moab\fn + 1 \fn*

\q Alas! in a night hath Ar-Moab
	\q2 Been wasted and ruined.
\q Alas! in a night hath Kir-Moab
	\q2 Been wasted and ruined.
\q \v 2  Gone up is the daughter\fn + 2 \fn* of Dibon
	\q2 To weep on the heights;\fn + 3 \fn*
\q On the summits of Nebo and Medeba
	\q2 Moab doth wail.
\q On every head there is baldness,
	\q2 And beards are all shorn.
\q \v 3 On her streets they have girt them with sackloth,
	\q2 On roofs is lamen;
\q On her squares, one and all they are wailing
	\q2 With torrents of tears.
\q \v 4 Heshbon and Elealeh cry out,
	\q2 And their cry reaches Jahaz;
\q Whereat Moab's loins fall a-quiver,
	\q2 The soul of her quiveres.
\q \v 5 My heart crieth out for Moab,
	\q2 They flee towards Zoar;\fn + 4 \fn*
 They climb the ascent unto Luhith.
	\q2 And weep as they go;
\q They raise on the way to Horonaim
	\q2 A cry of destruction.
\q \v 6 For ruin hath clean overtaken
	\q2 The waters of Nimrim;
\q The herbage is gone, the grass withered,
	\q2 And verdure is none.
\b
\q \v 7 So they bring o'er the Brook of the Willows\fn + 5 \fn*
	\q2 Their riches and stores;
\q \v 8 For the cry (of despair) hath gone round
	\q2 All the borders of Moab;
\q The wail thereof reacheth Eglaim,
	\q2 It reacheth Beer-elim.
\q \v 9 For the waters of Dimon are bloody.
	\q2 Yet more will I bring upon Dimon--
\q A lion on those that escape
	\q2 And are left out of Moab.
\b
\c 16
\q \v 2 And then at the fords of the Arnon
	\q2 The daughters of Moab
\q Shall flutter like birds, and shall fly
	\q2 As when nestlings are scattered.
\q \v 1 Tribute of lambs they despatched.
	\q2 To the lord of the land,\fn + 1 \fn*
\q From the Sela,\fn + 2 \fn* by way of the wikderness,
	\q2 Unto Mount Zion.
\q \v 3 ‟Grant us the laid of you counsel,\fn + 3 \fn*
	\q2 And mediate (for us);
\q shelter us as in the noon-tide
	\q2 With shade deep as night.
\q Bring into shelter the outcasts,
	\q2 Betray no the fugitives;
\q \v 4 Suffer the outcasts of Moab
	\q2 To dwell in thy land.
\q Be thou a shelter to them
	\q2 From the face of the spoiler.”
\b
\q When the ruthless are brought to an end,
	\q2 And the spoiler hath ceased;
\q When the heel of the tyrant hath vanished
	\q2 Clean out of the land;
\q \v 5 Then the throne\fn + 4 \fn* shall be stablished by kindness,
	\q2 And on it shall sit
\q In the tent of King David in faithfullness
	\q2 One who will judge
\q With a spirit intent on the right
	\q2 And on promptness of justice.
