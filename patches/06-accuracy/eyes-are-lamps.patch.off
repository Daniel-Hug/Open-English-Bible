; Eyes are Lamps

In Matthew:
    6:22    The lamp of the body is the eye. If your eye is unclouded, your whole body will be lit up; -> Your eyes are windows\f + Grk. The eye is a lamp\f* to your body. If they are clear and focussed\f + Grk. ἁπλοῦς (haplous).  Meanings include good, healthy, sincere, generous\f*, your whole body will be lit up 
    6:23    but, if your eye is diseased, your whole body will be darkened. And, if the inner light is darkness, how intense must that darkness be! -> but, if they are clouded by selfish greed\f + Grk. πονηρὸς (poneros). Meanings include evil, corrupt, greedy, selfish\f*, then your whole body will be darkened. And if the light you think is inside you is really darkness, how intense must that darkness be!
