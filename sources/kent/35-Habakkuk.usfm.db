\ms Habakkuk’s message

\p \v 1 The message seen by the prophet Habakkuk.

\s (Habbakuk)

\q \v 2 How long, [oeb:\nd Lord\nd*|:O Jehovah], have I cried out
   \q2 and [oeb:without you hearing me|:thou hearest not]! 
\q I cry to [oeb:you|:thee], “Violence!,”
	\q2 but [oeb:you do not help|:thou helpest not].
\q \v 3 Why [oeb:do you|:dost thou] make me look upon wickedness
   \q2 and behold trouble?
\q Destruction and violence are before [oeb:my|:mine] eyes,
    \q2 and [oeb:fighting|:strife] and [oeb:quarrelling|:contention]. 
\b 
\q \v 4 Therefore law is relaxed,
    \q2 and justice is never rendered;
\q for the wicked [oeb:surround|:encompass] the righteous,
    \q2 so that justice is perverted.

\s (The Lord)

\q \v 5 Look around [oeb:dealers of treason|:ye that deal treacherously], look well, 
	\q2 shudder and be shocked. 
\q For I am about to do a work in your days;
	\q2 [oeb:you will|:Ye shall] not believe it when it is told.
\b
\q \v 6 For [oeb:|:behold] I am about to raise up the Chaldeans, 
    \q2 a nation grim and quick of action
\q who go through the whole breadth of the earth
    \q2 to possess dwelling places not their own.
\q \v 7 Awful and terrible are they.
    \q2 [oeb:They write their own rules|:From them judgment goeth forth].
\q \v 8 Their horses are swifter than leopards,
    \q2 and their riders quicker than the wolves of evening.
\q From afar they come swooping down,
    \q2 like the eagle which hastens to devour.
\q \v 9 They all come to do violence,
    \q2 the direction of their faces is straight ahead,
    \q2 and they gather up captives like sand.
\b
\q \v 10 At kings they scoff,
    \q2 and princes are sport to them.
\q They laugh at every fortress.
    \q2 and heap up [oeb:earth|:dust] and take it.
\q \v 11 Then [oeb:they|:their spirit changes] [oeb:sweep on like the wind|:, and they pass by],
    \q2 [oeb:Their|:And they make their own] strength [oeb:is|:] their god.
	
\s (Habbakuk)

 \q \v 12 [oeb:Are you|:Art thou] not eternal, [oeb:\nd Lord\nd*|:O Jehovah], 
    \q2 my holy One, who [oeb:does not die|:diest not]? 
\q [oeb:\nd Lord\nd*|:O Jehovah] [oeb:you have|:thou has] appointed them for judgment, 
    \q2 [oeb:you have|:And thou, O Rock, hast] established them for correction[oeb:, my rock|:];
\q \v 13 With eyes too pure to see evil, 
    \q2 [oeb:can you not|:Who canst] not look on iniquity? 
\q Why [oeb:do you regard|:regardest thou] the treacherous in silence, 
    \q2 while the wicked swallows the upright? 
\b
\q \v 14 [oeb:You have made|:He treats] [oeb:people|:men] like the fish of the sea, 
    \q2 like reptiles that have no ruler. 
\q \v 15 [oeb:The wicked sweep|:He sweeps] them all into [oeb:their nets|:his net], 
    \q2 and [oeb:gather|:gathers] them into [oeb:their drag-nets|:his seine]. 
\q \v 16 Therefore they sacrifice to their net,
    \q2 and burn offerings to their drag-net;
\q for by [oeb:their nets|:them] [oeb:are|:is] their [oeb:portions generous|:portion fat],
    \q2 and their food is rich.
\q \v 17 Will [oeb:they|:he] empty [oeb:their|:his] [oeb:nets|:net] continually, 
    \q2 to slaughter nations unpityingly? 
\b
\q \c 2 \v 1 I will take my stand on my watch-tower, 
    \q2 and station myself on a turret. 
\q I will watch to see what [oeb:the \nd Lord\nd*|:he] will say to me, 
    \q2 what answer he will make to my complaint. 
	
\s (The Lord)

\q \v 2 Then [oeb:the \nd Lord\nd*|:Jehovah] answered me and said:
\q Inscribe the vision plainly on tablets, 
	\q2 [oeb:so|:] that even [oeb:someone running by could|:he who runs may] read it. 
\q \v 3 Though the vision waits for the time set,
    \q2 it hastens to fulfilment and will not fail; 
\q Though it linger long, wait for it. 
    \q2 For it surely will come and [oeb:will not be delayed|:not tarry]. 
\b
\q \v 4 The [oeb:the strength of the proud fails|:soul of the wicked faints within him], 
    \q2 but the upright lives by [neut:their|masc:his] faithfulness. 
\b
\q \v 5 [oeb:Wealth is|:Woe to the proud and] treacherous.
    \q2 the arrogant [oeb:never have|:one, who never has] enough,
\q [oeb:They|:Who] makes [oeb:their|:his] desire as wide as Sheol,
    \q2 [oeb: are|:He is] like death, unsatisfied,
\q For [oeb:they gather|:he hath gathered] to [oeb:themselves|:himself] all the nations,
    \q2 [oeb:bring|:And brought] together to [oeb:themselves|:himself] all peoples.
\q \v 6 [oeb:Shouldn't everyone mock them?|:Shall not these, all of them, take up a proverb against him]
    \q2 [oeb:sing|:And] a taunt-song against [oeb:them|:him], and say:
\b 
\q Woe to [neut:the person|masc:him] who amasses what is not [neut:theirs|masc:his], 
    \q2 and loads [neut:themself|masc:himself] down with pledges! 
\q \v 7 Will your debtors not suddenly rise, 
    \q2 and those who [oeb:will|:shall] overthrow you awake, 
	\q2 and you become their prey? 
\q \v 8 For as you have [oeb:plundered|:spoiled] many peoples, 
    \q2 the survivors [oeb:will|:shall] prey upon you.
\q [oeb:You have shed blood and committed violence]
	\q2 [oeb:to the earth, peoples and their cities.]
\b
\q \v 9 Woe to [neut:them|masc:him] who [oeb:seeks|:gets] [oeb:unjust|:false] gain [oeb:|:, and stores up evil] for [neut:their|masc:his] [oeb:dynasty|:house], 
\q [oeb:who sets their|:to set his] nest on high to be safe from the [oeb:reach|:grip] of misfortune! 
\b
\q \v 10 You have planned only shame for your [oeb:dynasty|:house]. 
\q You have [oeb:destroyed|:cut off] many peoples, 
    \q2 and brought guilt upon yourself; 
\q \v 11 the stone [oeb:will|:shall] cry out from the wall, 
    \q2 and the beam from the timber [oeb:will|:shall] answer it. 
\b
\q \v 12 Woe to [neut:the person|masc:him] who builds a city by bloodshed, 
    \q2 and founds a town by crime
\q \v 13 while the peoples toil for what fires [oeb:will|:shall] consume,
    \q2 and the nations weary themselves for nothing! 
 
\p [oeb:This the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts has said, |:] \v 14 [oeb:and the earth will be as full of the knowledge of the glory of the \nd Lord\nd* as the seas are full of water.|:]
 
\q \v 15 Woe to him who [oeb:in fury|:] gives drink to his neighbor 
    \q2 [oeb:to make him drunk, and see him naked.|:From the cup of your wrath till he be drunk, That you may gaze on his nakedness!]
\q \v 16 You are filled with shame, not glory; 
    \q2 drink yourself and be uncovered.
\q The cup from [oeb:the \nd Lord\nd*|:Jehovah]’s hand 
    \q2 [oeb:will|:Shall] pass in turn to you,
    \q2 and shame [oeb:will|:shall] cover your glory! 
\b
\q \v 17 For the violence done to Lebanon [oeb:will overwhelm you.|:shall cover thee]
    \q2 and the destruction of [oeb:animals|:the beasts] [oeb:will|:shall] terrify [oeb:you|:thee],
\q [oeb:because you shed|:For the shedding of] [oeb:people’s|:men's] blood on the earth,
    \q2 [oeb:destroyed people and their cities.|:]
\b
[oeb:
\q \v 18 What use is an idol?
\q A human made it,
    \q2 a metal image.
\q It cannot speak,
    \q2 it cannot teach truth,
\q Why does its maker trust it?
|:]
\b
\q \v 19 Woe to [neut:the person|masc:him] who [oeb:says|:saith] to a block, awake! 
    \q2 to a dumb stone, arise!
\q [oeb:It may be|:Behold, it is] set with gold and silver, 
    \q2 but there is no breath at all within it.
\q \v 20 [oeb:The \nd Lord\nd*|:Jehovah] is in his holy temple.
    \q2 Let all the earth be silent before him!

\s Habakkuk’s psalm
 
\p \v 1 [oeb:A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, according to the Sigionnoth.|:]
 
\q \v 2 I have heard, [oeb:\nd Lord\nd*|:O Jehovah], of [oeb:your|:thy] fame, 
    \q2 I have seen, [oeb:\nd Lord\nd*|:O Jehovah], [oeb:your|:thy] work;
\q through the years [oeb:you have|:thou dost] make [oeb:yourself|:thyself] known, 
    \q2 in wrath [oeb:you remember|:thou rememberest] mercy. 
\b
\q \v 3 God [oeb:comes|:cometh] from Teman,
    \q2 and the Holy One from the mountain-land of Paran. \it Selah\it*
\q His glory [oeb:covers|:covereth] the heavens,
    \q2 and his [us:splendor|cth:splendour] [oeb:fills|:filleth] the earth.
\q \v 4 Before him it is like the light,
    \q2 rays he [oeb:has|:hath] at his side,
    \q2 [oeb:where his power is hidden.|:and there is the hiding of his power,]
\q \v 4 Before him [oeb:pestilence|:Pestilence] [oeb:stalks|:stalketh],
    \q2 after him [oeb:plague|:Plague] [oeb:follows|:followeth].
\b
\q \v 6 He [oeb:stands|:standeth], and the earth [oeb:trembles|:trembleth],
    \q2 he [oeb:looks|:looketh], and the nations melt away,
\q and the mountains of old are scattered,
    \q2 the everlasting hills bow down.
\q These [oeb:are|:be] his ways from of old.
\q \v 7 The tents of Cushan are [oeb:afraid|:affrighted],
    \q2 the curtains of Midian tremble.
\b
\q \v 8 [oeb:Is your wrath|:Thou wroth], [oeb:\nd Lord\nd*|:O Jehovah], with the rivers? 
    \q2 Is [oeb:your|:thine] anger against the streams? 
    \q2 Or [oeb:your|:thy] wrath against the sea? 
\q [oeb:Is that why you|:That thou dost] ride on thy war-steeds?
    \q2 [oeb:Why you mount your|:That thou mountest thy] chariots of victory? 
\q \v 9 [oeb:Why you|:That thou makest] bare [oeb:your|:thy] bow? 
    \q2 [oeb:Why you fill your|:That thou fillest thy] quiver with shafts? 
\b
\q [oeb:You split|:Thou cleavest] the earth with torrents. 
    \q2 \v 10 The mountains see [oeb:you|:thee] and writhe. 
\q The tempest of waters sweeps by. 
    \q2 The great deep sends forth its voice. 
    \q2 The height lifts up its hands. 
\q \v 11 The sun forgets to rise. 
    \q2 The moon stands still in its place. 
\b
\q [oeb:Your|:Thine] arrows go forth to give light. 
    \q2 [oeb:Your|:Thy] glittering spear is as lightning.
\q \v 12 In rage [oeb:you stride|:thou stridest] over the earth. 
    \q2 In wrath [oeb:you trample|:thou tramplest] the nations. 
\q \v 13 [oeb:You go forth|:Thou goest forth] to save [oeb:your|:thy] people.
    \q2 [oeb:You go|:Thou goest] to help [oeb:your|:thine] anointed. 
\q [oeb:You crush|:Thou crushest] the head of the wicked [oeb:nation|:],
    \q2 laying [oeb:him|:] bare [oeb:from thigh|:the foundation] to [oeb:|:the] neck.  \it Selah\it*
\q \v 14 [oeb:You pierced|:Thou piercest] his head with his spears,
    \q2 as his champions storm out to scatter me,
    \q2 as they rejoice to devour the poor secretly.
\q \v 15 [oeb:You tread|:Thou treadest] the sea with [oeb:your|:thy] horses,
    \q2 while the mighty waters roar.
\b
\q \v 16 I heard, and my body trembles,
    \q2 and at the sound my lips quiver. 
\q My bones begin to decay, 
    \q2 and my footsteps totter beneath me, 
\q while I [oeb:long|:wait] for the day of distress 
    \q2 to come upon those who attack us. 
\b
\q \v 17 Though the fig-tree bears no fruit,
    \q2 and there [oeb:is|:be] no vintage on the vines,
\q though the olive harvest fails,
    \q2 and the fields produce no food,
\q though the flock be cut off from the fold, 
    \q2 and there [oeb:is|:be] no herd in the stalls, 
\q \v 18 yet I will exult in [oeb:the \nd Lord\nd*|:Jehovah], 
    \q2 and rejoice in the God who saves me. 
\q \v 19 [oeb:The Lord \nd God\nd*|:Jehovah the Lord] is my strength; 
    \q2 he makes my feet [oeb:as sure as|:like] [oeb:the feet of deer|:hinds’ feet],
    \q2 and causes me to walk on the heights!
