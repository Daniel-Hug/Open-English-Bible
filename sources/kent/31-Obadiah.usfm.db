\p \v 1 [oeb:The vision of Obadiah; what the \nd Lord\nd* said about Edom:|:]

\q [oeb:We have heard a report|:A report have we heard] from [oeb:the \nd Lord\nd*|:Jehovah],
      \q2 a messenger has been sent among the nations; 
\q [oeb:Rise|:] up, [oeb:|:and] let us rise against [oeb:Edom|:her] in battle!
\b
\q \v 2 [oeb:I will make you|:Behold, I have made thee] small among the nations, 
      \q2 [oeb:and|:Thou art] despised [neut:by all|masc:among men]!
\q \v 3 [oeb:Your|:Thy] proud heart [oeb:has|:hath] misled [oeb:you|:thee],
      \q2 [oeb:you|:Thou] who [oeb:live|:dwellest] in the clefts of the rock,
      \q2 [oeb:you|:Thou] who [oeb:build|:buildest] on high [oeb:your|:thy] dwelling. 
\q [oeb:You say|:who saith] to [oeb:yourselves|:thyself],
      \q2 ‘Who [oeb:can|:shall] bring me down to earth?’
\q \v 4 Though [oeb:you|:thou] [oeb:build|:buildest] high as the eagle,
      \q2 though between the stars [oeb:you|:thou] set [oeb:your|:thy] nest,
\q from there will I bring [oeb:you|:thee] down, 
      \q2 [oeb:says the \nd Lord\nd*|:is Jehovah’s oracle].
\b
\q \v 5 If thieves had come to [oeb:you, marauders|:thee] by night
      \q2 would they not have stolen only as much as they needed?
\q If grape-gatherers had come to [oeb:you|:thee]
      \q2 would they not have left some gleanings?
\q \v 6 [oeb:Descendents of Esau,
      \q2 all your treasures are looted.|:]
\q \v 7 [oeb:To|:But to] [oeb:your|:the very] border they have driven [oeb:you|:thee], 
      \q2 all [oeb:your|:thy] allies have betrayed [oeb:you|:thee].
\q [oeb:Your|:Thy] avowed friends have overpowered [oeb:you|:thee],
      \q2 they have set a trap for [oeb:you|:thee].
\q [oeb:Where is your wisdom now?|:]

\p \v 8 [oeb:The \nd Lord\nd* says:

\q On that day,
\q I will destroy the wise of Edom,
      \q2 drive wisdom out of Mount Esau. 
\q \v 9 Your warriors will be filled with terror, Teman,
      \q2 none will be left alive on Mount Esau.|:]
\b
\q \v 10 Because of the [oeb:violence done to your relatives, the people of|:outraging of thy brother] Jacob[hebfootnote:\f + Heb. your brother Jacob\f*|:] 
      \q2 shame [oeb:covers|:doth cover] [oeb:you|:thee],
	  \q2 [oeb:you|:and thee] [oeb:are|:art] cut off forever.
\q \v 11 In the day when [oeb:you|:thee] [oeb:stood|:didst stand] aloof,
      \q2 in the day when strangers carried away [oeb:their|:his] wealth, 
      \q2 and [oeb:strangers|:aliens] entered into [oeb:their|:his] gates,
      \q2 and over Jerusalem [oeb:|:they] cast lots,
\q [oeb:you|:Thou] [oeb:were|:also wert] as one of [oeb:those strangers|:them].
\b
\q \v 12 [oeb:You|:Thou] [oeb:should|:shouldst] not have gloated in the day of [oeb:your|:thy] [oeb:relatives:|:brother], 
      \q2 in the day of [oeb:their|:his] misfortune.
\q [oeb:You|:Thou] [oeb:should|:shouldst] not have exulted over the land of Judah 
      \q2 in the day of [oeb:their|:his] destruction.
\q [oeb:You|:Thou] [oeb:should|:shouldst] not have laughed loudly
      \q2 in [oeb:their|:his] distress.
\q \v 13 [oeb:You|:Thou] [oeb:should|:shouldst] not have entered in at the gate of my people
      \q2 in the day of [oeb:their|:his] disaster.
\q [oeb:You|:Thou] [oeb:should|:shouldst] not have gloated [oeb:over|:, yea, thou, upon] [oeb:their|:his] calamity, 
      \q2 in the day of [oeb:their|:his] disaster,
\q nor stretched out [oeb:your|:thine] hand after [oeb:their|:his] wealth 
      \q2 in the day of [oeb:their|:his] disaster,
\q \v 14 nor stood at the parting of the ways 
      \q2 to cut [oeb:down|:off] [oeb:their|:his] fugitives,
\q nor [oeb:should|:shouldst] [oeb:you|:thee] have [oeb:betrayed|:intercepted] [oeb:their|:his] [oeb:refugees|:escaped ones]
      \q2 in the day of distress.
\b
\q \v 15 [oeb:Near at hand|:Verily near] is [oeb:the \nd Lord\nd*|:Jehovah]'s day [oeb:for|:upon] all the nations. 
\q As [oeb:you|:thee] [oeb:have|:hast] done so [oeb:will|:shall] it be done to [oeb:you|:thee].
\q [oeb:Your|:Thy] deed [oeb:will|:shall] come back upon [oeb:your|:thine] own head.
\b
\q \v 16 [oeb:As you|:Verily as ye] have drunk upon my holy mountain,
      \q2 so all the nations [oeb:will|:shall] drink [oeb:in turn|:continually];
\q They [oeb:will|:shall] drink [oeb:deep|:and reel] 
      \q2 and be as though they had not been.
\b
\q \v 17 But on Mount Zion [oeb:some will escape|:there shall be a refuge],
      \q2 and those of the house of Jacob 
      \q2 [oeb:will|:shall] again enter into their possessions.
\q For the house of Jacob [oeb:will|:shall] be a fire, 
      \q2 and the house of Joseph a flame,
\q but the house of Esau [oeb:will|:shall] become stubble.
      \q2 They [oeb:will|:shall] kindle and devour [oeb:it|:them].
\q [oeb:Not|:And there shall not] even one [oeb:|:escape] of the house of Esau [oeb:will escape|:], 
      \q2 for [oeb:the \nd Lord\nd*|:Jehovah] [oeb:has|:hath] spoken.
\b
\q \v 19 They [oeb:will|:shall] possess the [oeb:Negeb|:South Country] and [oeb:Mount Esau|:the western lowland],
      \q2 [oeb:and the Shephelah of the Philistines.|:]
\q [oeb:They|:And they] [oeb:will|:shall] possess the territory of Ephraim and Gilead,
      \q2 [oeb:and Benjamin will possess Gilead.|:]
\q \v 20 The [oeb:exiles|:remnant] of Israel [oeb:will|:shall] possess the land of the Canaanites 
      \q2 [oeb:as far as|:even to] Zarephath.
\q The captives of Jerusalem [oeb:who are in Sepharad|:]
      \q2 [oeb:will|:shall] possess the cities of the [oeb:Negreb|:south].
\q \v 21 [oeb:The rescued|:Saviours] [oeb:will|:shall] come up on Mount Zion to judge Mount Esau, 
      \q2 and the [oeb:kingdom|:dominion] [oeb:will|:shall] belong to [oeb:the \nd Lord\nd*|:Jehovah].
